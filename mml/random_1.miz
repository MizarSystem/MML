theorem
  for Omega be non empty finite set, X be Real-Valued-Random-Variable of
  Trivial-SigmaField (Omega) holds ex G being FinSequence of REAL, s being
FinSequence of Omega st len G = card (Omega) & s is one-to-one & rng s = Omega
& len s = card (Omega) & (for n being Nat st n in dom G holds G.n = X.(s.n) ) &
  expect(X,Trivial-Probability (Omega)) = (Sum G) / card (Omega)
proof
  let Omega be non empty finite set, X be Real-Valued-Random-Variable of
  Trivial-SigmaField (Omega);
  set P= Trivial-Probability (Omega);
  consider F being FinSequence of REAL, s being FinSequence of Omega such that
A1: len F = card (Omega) and
A2: s is one-to-one & rng s = Omega and
A3: len s = card (Omega) and
A4: for n being Nat st n in dom F holds F.n = X.(s.n) * P.{s.n} and
A5: expect(X,P) = Sum F by Th33;
  deffunc GF(Nat) = X.(s.$1);
  consider G being FinSequence of REAL such that
A6: len G = len F & for j being Nat st j in dom G holds G.j = GF(j) from
  FINSEQ_2:sch 1;
A7: dom F = dom G by A6,FINSEQ_3:31;
A8: now
    let n be Nat;
    assume
A9: n in dom F;
    dom s= Seg len s by FINSEQ_1:def 3
      .= dom F by A1,A3,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
    then s.n in Omega by A9,PARTFUN1:27;
    then reconsider A={s.n} as El_ev of Omega by RPR_1:7;
A10: P.{s.n} = prob(A) by Def1
      .=1/card (Omega) by RPR_1:38;
    thus ((1/card (Omega))(#)G).n = (1/card (Omega))*G.n by VALUED_1:6
      .= (1/card (Omega))*X.(s.n) by A6,A7,A9
      .= F.n by A4,A9,A10;
  end;
  take G;
  dom F = dom ((1/card (Omega))(#)G) by A7,VALUED_1:def 5;
  then (1/card (Omega))(#)G = F by A8,FINSEQ_1:17;
  hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,A5,A6,RVSUM_1:117;

  for X be Real-Valued-Random-Variable of Sigma st 0 < r & X is
nonnegative & X is_integrable_on P holds P.({t where t is Element of Omega : r

proof
  let X be Real-Valued-Random-Variable of Sigma;
  assume that
A1: 0 < r and
A2: X is nonnegative and

  consider S be Element of Sigma such that
A4: S=Omega and

    then
A8: ex t be Element of Omega st x=t & r <= X.t;
    then x in great_eq_dom(X,r) by A4,A7,MESFUNC1:def 15;
    hence x in S /\ great_eq_dom(X,r) by A4,A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
  end;
  then K c= S /\ great_eq_dom(X,r) by TARSKI:def 3;
  then S /\ great_eq_dom(X,r) = K by A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

  expect (X,P)=Integral(PM,X) by A3,Def4;
  then reconsider IX=Integral(PM,X) as Element of REAL;
  reconsider PMK=PM.K as Element of REAL by XXREAL_0:14;
A10: for t be Element of Omega st t in K holds r <= X.t
  proof
    let t be Element of Omega;
    assume t in K;
