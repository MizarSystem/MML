Lm1: for r,g,r1 be real number holds 0<g & r<=r1 implies r-g<r1 & r<r1+g
proof
 let r,g,r1 be real number;
 assume A1: 0<g & r<=r1; then r-g<r1-0 by REAL_1:92;
 hence r-g<r1; r+0<r1+g by A1,REAL_1:67; hence thesis;
end;

Lm2: for X be Subset of REAL st rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2)/\X holds
rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2) & rng seq c= X & dom(f1(#)f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 &
rng seq c=dom f1 & rng seq c=dom f2 & rng seq c=dom f1/\X & rng seq c=dom f2/\X
proof let X be Subset of REAL such that A1: rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2)/\X;
   dom(f1(#)f2)/\X c=dom(f1(#)f2) & dom(f1(#)f2)/\X c=X by XBOOLE_1:17;
 hence A2: rng seq c=dom(f1(#)f2) & rng seq c=X by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
 thus dom(f1(#)f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 by SEQ_1:def 5;
 then dom(f1(#)f2)c=dom f1 & dom(f1(#)f2)c=dom f2 by XBOOLE_1:17;
 hence rng seq c=dom f1 & rng seq c=dom f2 by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
 hence rng seq c=dom f1/\X & rng seq c=dom f2/\X by A2,XBOOLE_1:19;
end;

Lm3: r-1/(n+1)<r & r<r+1/(n+1)
proof
   0<n+1 by NAT_1:19;
 then 0<1/(n+1) by SEQ_2:6; hence thesis by Lm1;
end;

Lm4: for X be Subset of REAL st rng seq c=dom(f1+f2)/\X holds
rng seq c=dom(f1+f2) & rng seq c= X & dom(f1+f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 &
rng seq c=dom f1/\X & rng seq c=dom f2/\X
proof let X be Subset of REAL such that A1: rng seq c=dom(f1+f2)/\X;
   dom(f1+f2)/\X c=dom(f1+f2) & dom(f1+f2)/\X c=X by XBOOLE_1:17;
 hence A2: rng seq c=dom(f1+f2) & rng seq c=X by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
 thus dom(f1+f2)=dom f1/\dom f2 by SEQ_1:def 3;
 then dom(f1+f2)c=dom f1 & dom(f1+f2)c=dom f2 by XBOOLE_1:17;
 then rng seq c=dom f1 & rng seq c=dom f2 by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
 hence rng seq c=dom f1/\X & rng seq c=dom f2/\X by A2,XBOOLE_1:19;

:11;
 then consider n such that A6: for k st n<=
k holds 0<(seq-s).k by A5,LIMFUNC1:29;
 take n; let k; assume n<=k; then 0<(seq-s).k by A6;
 then 0<seq.k-s.k by RFUNCT_2:6; then 0<seq.k-r by A2; then 0+r<seq.k by REAL_1

 then A5: s-seq is convergent by A1,SEQ_2:25; s.0=r by A2;
 then lim s=r by A3,SEQ_4:40; then lim(s-seq)=r-lim seq by A1,A4,SEQ_2:26;
 then 0<lim(s-seq) by A1,SQUARE_1:11; then consider n such that
 A6: for k st n<=k holds 0<(s-seq).k by A5,LIMFUNC1:29
; take n; let k;assume n<=k;
 then 0<(s-seq).k by A6; then 0<s.k-seq.k by RFUNCT_2:6; then 0<r-seq.k by A2;
 then 0+seq.k<r by REAL_1:86; hence seq.k<r;
