definition
  let n,m;
  let a be set;
  func (n,m) --> a -> tabular FinSequence equals

end;

definition
  let D,n,m;

theorem Th1:
  [i,j] in Indices ((n,m)-->a) implies ((n,m)-->a) * (i,j)=a
proof
  reconsider m1=m as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 13;
  set M=(n,m)-->a;
  assume
A1: [i,j] in Indices M;
  then i in dom M by ZFMISC_1:106;

  then
A2: i in Seg n by MATRIX_1:def 3;
  then
A3: n > 0;
  j in Seg width M by A1,ZFMISC_1:106;
  then j in Seg m by A3,MATRIX_1:24;
  then

  M.i=m1|->a by A2,FUNCOP_1:13;
  hence thesis by A1,A4,MATRIX_1:def 6;

theorem
  ((n,n)-->a9) + ((n,n)-->b9)= (n,n)-->(a9+b9)
proof

    assume
A3: [i,j] in Indices ((n,n)-->(a9+b9));
    then ((n,n)-->a9)*(i,j)=a9 by A1,Th1;
    then ((n,n)-->a9)*(i,j) +((n,n)-->b9)*(i,j)=a9+b9 by A2,A1,A3,Th1;
    hence
    ((n,n)-->a9)*(i,j) +((n,n)-->b9)*(i,j)=((n,n)-->(a9+b9))*(i,j) by A3,Th1;

  x2)][(y1,y2)=[:Seg 2,Seg 2:]
proof
  set M = (x1,x2)][(y1,y2);
  thus
A1: len M=2 by FINSEQ_1:61;
  rng M = { <*x1,x2*>,<*y1,y2*>} by FINSEQ_2:147;
  then
A2: <*x1,x2*> in rng M by TARSKI:def 2;

proof
  set M=<*<*a*>*>;
  Indices M= [:Seg 1,Seg 1:] & 1 in Seg 1 by FINSEQ_1:4,MATRIX_1:25
,TARSKI:def 1;
  hence
A1: [1,1] in Indices <*<*a*>*> by ZFMISC_1:106;
  M.1= <*a*> & <*a*>.1=a by FINSEQ_1:57;

  let x be Element of K;
  let p be Element of Permutations(n);
  func -(x,p) -> Element of K equals
  x if p is even otherwise -x;
  correctness;
end;

definition
  let X be set;
  assume
A1: X is finite;
  func FinOmega X -> Element of Fin X equals
  X;
  coherence by A1,FINSUB_1:def 5;
end;

theorem
  Permutations n is finite
proof
A1: Permutations n c= Funcs(Seg n,Seg n)
  proof
    let x;
    assume x in Permutations n;
    then x is Function of Seg n,Seg n by Def11;
    hence thesis by FUNCT_2:12;
  end;
  Funcs(Seg n,Seg n) is finite by FRAENKEL:16;
  hence thesis by A1,FINSET_1:13;
end;
