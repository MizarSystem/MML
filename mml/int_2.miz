definition
  let a be integer number;
  redefine func abs a -> Element of NAT;
  coherence
  proof
    per cases;
    suppose
A1:   a >= 0;
      then abs a = a by ABSVALUE:def 1;
      hence thesis by A1,INT_1:16;
    end;
    suppose
      a < 0;
      then abs a = -a & -a > 0 by ABSVALUE:def 1,XREAL_1:60;
      hence thesis by INT_1:16;
    end;
  end;

reserve a,b,c for Integer;

theorem Th1:
  a divides b & a divides b + c implies a divides c
proof
  given u being Integer such that
A1: b = a * u;
  given t being Integer such that
A2: b + c = a * t;
  c = a*(t - u) by A1,A2;
  hence thesis by INT_1:def 9;
end;

theorem Th2: :: NAT_D:9
  a divides b implies a divides b * c
proof
  assume
  a divides b;
  then consider l being Integer such that
A1: b = a * l by INT_1:def 9;
  a * l * c = a * (l * c);
  hence thesis by A1,INT_1:def 9;
end;

theorem Th3:
  0 divides a iff a = 0
proof
  0 divides a implies a = 0
  proof
    assume
    0 divides a;
    then ex b being Integer st a = 0*b by INT_1:def 9;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

Lm1: a divides -a & -a divides a
proof
  -a = a*(-1);
  hence a divides -a by INT_1:def 9;
  a = (-a)*(-1);
  hence thesis by INT_1:def 9;
end;

Lm2: a divides b & b divides c implies a divides c
proof
  assume that
A1: a divides b and
A2: b divides c;
  consider k being Integer such that
A3: b = a*k by A1,INT_1:def 9;
  consider l being Integer such that
A4: c = b*l by A2,INT_1:def 9;
  c = a*(k*l) by A3,A4;
  hence thesis by INT_1:def 9;
end;

Lm3: a divides b iff a divides -b
proof
A1: a divides -b implies a divides b
  proof
    assume
A2: a divides -b;
    -b divides b by Lm1;

  end;
  a divides b implies a divides -b
  proof
    assume
A3: a divides b;
    b divides -b by Lm1;
    hence thesis by A3,Lm2;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1;
end;

Lm4: a divides b iff -a divides b
proof
A1: -a divides b implies a divides b
  proof
    assume
A2: -a divides b;
    a divides -a by Lm1;

  end;
  a divides b implies -a divides b
  proof
    assume
A3: a divides b;
    -a divides a by Lm1;
    hence thesis by A3,Lm2;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1;
end;

Lm5: a divides 0 & 1 divides a & -1 divides a
proof
  0 = a*0;
  hence a divides 0 by INT_1:def 9;
  a = 1*a;
  hence 1 divides a by INT_1:def 9;
  a = (-1)*(-a);
  hence thesis by INT_1:def 9;
end;

Lm6: a divides b & a divides c implies a divides b mod c
proof
  assume that
A1: a divides b and
A2: a divides c;
A3: now
    assume
    c <> 0;
    then
A4: b = c * (b div c) + (b mod c) by INT_1:86;
    a divides c * (b div c) by A2,Th2;
    hence thesis by A1,A4,Th1;
  end;
  now
    assume
    c = 0;
    then b mod c = 0 by INT_1:def 8;
    hence thesis by Lm5;

  hence thesis by A3;
end;

reserve i,j,k,l for Nat;

Lm7: k divides l iff ex t being Nat st l = k * t
proof
  hereby
    assume

    thus ex t being Nat st l = k * t
    proof
A2:   k >= 0 by NAT_1:2;
      consider t being Integer such that
A3:   l = k * t by A1,INT_1:def 9;
      per cases by NAT_1:3;
      suppose
        0 < l;
        then 0 <= t by A3,A2,XREAL_1:133;
        then reconsider t as Element of NAT by INT_1:16;
        take t;
        thus l = k * t by A3;
      end;
      suppose
A4:     l = 0;
        take 0;
        thus l = k*0 by A4;
      end;
    end;
  end;
  assume
  ex t being Nat st l = k * t;
  hence thesis by INT_1:def 9;
end;

  proof
A3: i >= 0 by NAT_1:2;
    assume
A4: i<>0;
    1*i = i*(a*b) by A1,A2;
    then a*b = 1 by A4,XCMPLX_1:5;

      then c*a gcd c*b = c*1 or c*a gcd c*b = c*(-1) by A5,Th17;
      then c*a gcd c*b = c*1 or c*a gcd c*b = (-c)*1;
