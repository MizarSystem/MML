begin :: On the standard computers

reserve i, j, k for Element of NAT,
  n for Element of NAT,
  IL for non empty set,
  N for with_non-empty_elements set;

Lm1: for a,A being set st A /\ {a} <> {} holds a in A
proof
  let a,A be set;
  assume A /\ {a} <> {};
  then A meets {a} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  hence thesis by ZFMISC_1:56;
end;

begin :: SCM R

reserve R for good Ring,
  a, b for Data-Location of R,
  loc for
  Element of NAT,
  I for Instruction of SCM R,
  p for FinPartState of SCM R,
  s, s1, s2 for State of SCM R,
  q for FinPartState of SCM;

theorem Th1:
  the carrier of SCM R = {IC SCM R} \/ Data-Locations SCM \/ NAT
proof
  IC SCM R = IC SCM by AMI_3:4,SCMRING2:9;
  hence thesis by AMI_5:23,SCMRING2:def 1;
end;

theorem
  (the Object-Kind of SCM R).loc = SCM-Instr R
proof
  reconsider i = loc as Element of NAT;
  thus (the Object-Kind of SCM R).loc = (SCM-OK R).i by SCMRING2:def 1
    .= SCM-Instr R by SCMRING1:6;
end;

theorem Th3:
  dl.(R,n) = [1,n]

theorem
  for dl being Data-Location of R ex i being Element of NAT st dl = dl.(
  R,i)
proof
  let dl be Data-Location of R;

  then consider i being Element of NAT such that
A1: dl = [1,i] by AMI_2:32,AMI_3:72;
  take i;
  thus thesis by A1,Th3;
end;

theorem
  for i,j being Element of NAT holds i <> j implies dl.(R,i) <> dl.(R,j)
proof
  let i,j be Element of NAT;
  assume
A1: i <> j;
  dl.(R,j) = [1,j] & dl.(R,i) = [1,i] by Th3;
  hence thesis by A1,ZFMISC_1:33;
end;

theorem Th7:
  a <> loc
proof
  assume a = loc;
  then loc in (the carrier of SCM R) \ (NAT \/ {NAT}) by SCMRING2:def 2;
  then not loc in NAT \/ {NAT} by XBOOLE_0:def 5;

proof
  Data-Locations SCM R = Data-Locations SCM by SCMRING2:31;

theorem Th13:
  dom DataPart p c= Data-Locations SCM
proof
  Data-Locations SCM R = Data-Locations SCM by SCMRING2:31;
  hence thesis by RELAT_1:87;

theorem Th20:
  s.a = (s +* Start-At(loc,SCM R)).a
proof
  a in the carrier of SCM R;
  then a in dom s by PARTFUN1:def 4;

dom (Start-At(loc,SCM R)) by FUNCOP_1:19,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
  a <> IC SCM R by SCMRING3:3;
  then not a in {IC SCM R} by TARSKI:def 1;

theorem Th21:
  IC(s1) = IC(s2) & (for a being Data-Location of R holds s1.a =
  s2.a) & (for i being Element of NAT holds s1.i = s2.i) implies
  s1 = s2
proof
  assume that
