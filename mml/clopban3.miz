  CNORMSTR);
  let seq be sequence of X such that
A1: for n be Element of NAT holds seq.n = 0.X;
  let m be Element of NAT;
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means seq.$1 = (Partial_Sums seq).$1;
A2: for k be Element of NAT st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof
    let k be Element of NAT such that
A3: P[k];
    thus seq.(k+1) = 0.X + seq.(k+1) by RLVECT_1:10
      .= (Partial_Sums seq).k + seq.(k+1) by A1,A3
      .= (Partial_Sums seq).(k+1) by BHSP_4:def 1;

A4: P[0] by BHSP_4:def 1;
  for n be Element of NAT holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A4,A2);

proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq be sequence of X;
  let m be Element of NAT;
  ||.seq.||.m = ||.seq.m.|| by NORMSP_0:def 4;

theorem Th3:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, x,y,z be Element of X holds ||.x-y.||
  = ||.(x-z)+(z-y).||
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let x,y,z be Element of X;
  thus ||.x-y.|| = ||.x-0.X-y.|| by RLVECT_1:26
    .= ||.x-(z-z)-y.|| by RLVECT_1:16

theorem Th4:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, seq be sequence of X holds seq is
  convergent implies for s be Real st 0 < s ex n be Element of NAT st for m be
  Element of NAT st n<=m holds ||.seq.m -seq.n.||<s
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq be sequence of X;
  assume seq is convergent;
  then consider g1 be Element of X such that
A1: for s be Real st 0<s ex n be Element of NAT st for m be Element of
  NAT st n<=m holds ||.seq.m -g1.||<s by CLVECT_1:def 16;

    then ||.seq.m -g1.||+||.g1-seq.n.||<s/2+s/2 by A3,XREAL_1:10;

theorem Th5:
  for X be ComplexNormSpace, seq be sequence of X holds seq is
Cauchy_sequence_by_Norm iff for p be Real st p > 0 holds ex n be Element of NAT
  st for m be Element of NAT st n <= m holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< p
proof
  let X be ComplexNormSpace;
  let seq be sequence of X;
A1: now
    assume
A2: for p be Real st p > 0 holds ex n be Element of NAT st for m be
    Element of NAT st n <= m holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< p;
    now
      let s be Real;
      assume 0<s;
      then consider k be Element of NAT such that
A3:   for m be Element of NAT st k<=m holds ||.seq.m -seq.k.||<s/2 by A2,
XREAL_1:217;
      now
        let m,n be Element of NAT such that
A4:     k<=m and
A5:     k<=n;
        ||.seq.n -seq.k.||<s/2 by A3,A5;
        then
A6:     ||.seq.k-seq.n.||<s/2 by CLVECT_1:109;
        ||.seq.m -seq.k.||<s/2 by A3,A4;
        then
A7:     ||.seq.m -seq.k.||+||.seq.k-seq.n.||<s/2+s/2 by A6,XREAL_1:10;
        ||.seq.m -seq.k+(seq.k-seq.n).|| <=||.seq.m -seq.k.||+||.seq.k-
seq.n.|| & ||.seq.m -seq.k+(seq.k-seq.n).|| =||.seq.m -seq.n.|| by Th3,
CLVECT_1:def 14;
        hence ||.seq.m -seq.n.|| < s by A7,XXREAL_0:2;
      end;
      hence ex k be Element of NAT st for m,n be Element of NAT st k <= m & k
      <=n holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< s;
    end;
    hence seq is Cauchy_sequence_by_Norm by CSSPACE3:10;
  end;
  now
    assume
A8: seq is Cauchy_sequence_by_Norm;
    thus for p be Real st p > 0 holds ex n be Element of NAT st for m be
    Element of NAT st n <= m holds ||.seq.m-seq.n.||< p
    proof
      let p be Real;
      assume p >0;
      then consider n be Element of NAT such that

  let m be Element of NAT;
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means ||.seq.||.$1 = (Partial_Sums ||.seq.||).$1;
A2: for k be Element of NAT st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof
    let k be Element of NAT such that
A3: P[k];
    thus ||.seq.||.(k+1) =0 + ||.seq.||.(k+1)
      .= ||.0.X.|| + ||.seq.||.(k+1)
      .= ||.seq.k.|| + ||.seq.||.(k+1) by A1

      .= (Partial_Sums ||.seq.||).(k+1) by SERIES_1:def 1;
  end;
A4: P[0] by SERIES_1:def 1;
  for n be Element of NAT holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A4,A2);
  hence (Partial_Sums ||.seq.||).m = ||.seq.||.m

    .= 0;

  consider Nseq be increasing sequence of NAT such that

proof
  let X be Complex_Banach_Algebra;

  thus x+y = y+x;
  thus (x+y)+z = x+(y+z) by RLVECT_1:def 6;
  thus x+(0.X) = x by RLVECT_1:def 7;
  thus ex t being Element of X st x+t=0.X by ALGSTR_0:def 11;
  thus (x*y)*z = x*(y*z) by GROUP_1:def 4;
  thus 1r*x = x by CLVECT_1:def 5;
  thus 0c*x = 0.X by CLVECT_1:2;
  thus a*0.X =0.X by CLVECT_1:2;
  thus (-1r)*x = -x by CLVECT_1:4;
  thus x*(1.X) = x & (1.X)*x= x & x*(y+z) = x*y + x*z & (y+z)*x = y*x + z*x &
a*(x*y) = (a*x)*y & a*(x+y) = a*x + a*y & (a+b)*x = a*x + b*x & (a*b)*x = a*(b*
  x) by CFUNCDOM:def 9,CLVECT_1:def 2,def 3,def 4,VECTSP_1:def 11,def 12,def 13

  x*0.X =x*(0.X+0.X) by RLVECT_1:def 7

  then 0.X = x*0.X + x*0.X-x* 0.X by RLVECT_1:28;
  then 0.X = x*0.X + (x*0.X-x* 0.X) by RLVECT_1:def 6;

  0.X*x =(0.X+0.X)*x by RLVECT_1:def 7

  hence 0.X * x = 0.X & x*0.X =0.X by A2,RLVECT_1:def 7;

    .=(y-z)*x+(z*x-z*x) by RLVECT_1:28
    .=y*x-z*x by A3,RLVECT_1:def 6;

  thus x-y+z = x-(y-z) by RLVECT_1:43;
