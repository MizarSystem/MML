proof
  let x,y be R_eal;

  for x,y be R_eal holds y-x <= |.x-y.|
proof
  let x,y be R_eal;
  -|.x-y.| <= (x-y) by EXTREAL2:57;

  assume that
A1: k <= 2|^n*n and

or sup rng J = +infty

proof
  let J be ExtREAL_sequence;
  assume
  J is without-infty;
  then
A1: -infty < J.1 by Def5;
  dom J = NAT by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  then not -infty is UpperBound of rng J by A1,FUNCT_1:12,XXREAL_2:def 1;
  then sup rng J <> -infty by XXREAL_2:def 3;
