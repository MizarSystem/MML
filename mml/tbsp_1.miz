    let n,m such that A2:n<=m;
      per cases by A2,REAL_1:def 5;
    suppose n<m;

    end;
    suppose n=m;
     hence L to_power n >= L to_power m;
    end;

    proof
          L to_power 0 = 1 by POWER:29;

      hence thesis;
    end;
  A3: for k st X[k] holds X[k+1]
    proof
      let k be Nat such that
      A4: L to_power k <= 1 & 0 < L to_power k;
