theorem
  X is convex & B is convex implies X (O) B is convex & X (o) B is
  convex
proof
  assume that
A1: X is convex and
A2: B is convex;
  X (-) B is convex by A1,A2,Th77;
  hence X (O) B is convex by A2,Th77;
  X (+) B is convex by A1,A2,Th77;
  hence thesis by A2,Th77;

theorem
  B is convex & 0 < t & 0 < s implies (s+t)(.)B = s(.)B (+) t(.)B
proof
  assume that
A1: B is convex and
A2: 0 < t & 0 < s;
  thus (s+t)(.)B c= s(.)B (+) t(.)B
  proof
    let x be set;
    assume
    x in (s+t)(.)B;
    then consider b being Point of TOP-REAL n such that
A3: x=(s+t)*b and
A4: b in B;
A5: t*b in t(.)B by A4;
    x = s*b +t*b & s*b in s(.)B by A3,A4,EUCLID:37;
    hence thesis by A5;
  end;
  let x be set;
  assume
  x in s(.)B (+) t(.)B;
  then consider s1,s2 being Point of TOP-REAL n such that
A6: x=s1+s2 and
A7: s1 in s(.)B and
A8: s2 in t(.)B;
  consider b2 being Point of TOP-REAL n such that
A9: s2=t*b2 and
A10: b2 in B by A8;
  consider b1 being Point of TOP-REAL n such that
A11: s1=s*b1 and
A12: b1 in B by A7;
  s/(s+t) < (s+t)/(s+t) by A2,XREAL_1:31,76;
  then s/(s+t) < 1 by A2,XCMPLX_1:60;
  then (s/(s+t))*b1 +(1-s/(s+t))*b2 in B by A1,A2,A12,A10,Def11;
  then (s+t)*((s/(s+t))*b1 +(1-s/(s+t))*b2) in {(s+t)*zz where zz is Point of

  then (s+t)*((s/(s+t))*b1) +(s+t)*((1-s/(s+t))*b2) in (s+t)(.)B by
  EUCLID:36;
  then (s+t)*(s/(s+t))*b1 +(s+t)*((1-s/(s+t))*b2) in (s+t)(.)B by EUCLID:
  34;
  then (s+t)*(s/(s+t))*b1 +(s+t)*(1-s/(s+t))*b2 in (s+t)(.)B by
  EUCLID:34;
  then s*b1 +(s+t)*(1-s/(s+t))*b2 in (s+t)(.)B by A2,XCMPLX_1:88;
  then s*b1 +(s+t)*((s+t)/(s+t)-s/(s+t))*b2 in (s+t)(.)B by A2,
  XCMPLX_1:60;
  then s*b1 +(s+t)*((s+t-s)/(s+t))*b2 in (s+t)(.)B by XCMPLX_1:121;
