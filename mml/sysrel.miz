theorem Th58:
  (S * R = S & R * (R \ id dom R) = {} implies CL(S) c= CL(R)) &
  (R * S = S & (R \ id dom R) * R = {} implies CL(S) c= CL(R))
proof
  thus S * R = S & R * (R \ id dom R) = {} implies CL S c= CL R
  proof
    assume that
A1: S * R = S and
A2: R * (R \ id dom R) = {};
A3: S * (R \ id dom R) = {} by A1,A2,Th57;
    for x,y holds [x,y] in CL S implies [x,y] in CL R
    proof
      let x,y;
      assume

A5:   [x,y] in id dom S by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
      [x,y] in S by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
      then consider z such that
A6:   [x,z] in S and
A7:   [z,y] in R by A1,RELAT_1:def 8;
A8:   z = y
      proof
        assume z <> y;
        then not [z,y] in id dom R by RELAT_1:def 10;
        then [z,y] in R \ id dom R by A7,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
        hence contradiction by A3,A6,RELAT_1:def 8;
      end;
A9:   x = y by A5,RELAT_1:def 10;
      then x in dom R by A7,A8,RELAT_1:20;
      then

      [x,y] in R by A5,A7,A8,RELAT_1:def 10;
