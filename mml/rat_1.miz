    assume that
A7: numerator(q)=-denominator(p) and
A8: denominator(q)=-numerator( p);
    thus p<0 by A8,Th27;
    thus q=(-denominator(p))/(-numerator(p)) by A7,A8,Th37
      .=-(denominator(p)/(-numerator(p)))
      .=-(-denominator(p)/numerator(p)) by XCMPLX_1:189
      .=(1*denominator(p))/numerator(p)
      .=1/(numerator(p)/denominator(p)) by XCMPLX_1:78
      .=1/p by Th37;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1;
end;
