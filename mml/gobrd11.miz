  r,s,r1,r2,s1,s2,sb,tb for Real,
  x for set,
  GX for non empty TopSpace;

Lm1: sqrt 2>0 by SQUARE_1:93;

theorem Th1:
  for A being Subset of GX, p being Point of GX st p in A & A is
  connected holds A c= Component_of p
proof
  let A be Subset of GX, p be Point of GX;
  consider F being Subset-Family of GX such that
A1: for B being Subset of GX holds B in F iff B is connected & p in B and
A2: union F = Component_of p by CONNSP_1:def 7;

theorem
  for A,B,C being Subset of GX st C is a_component & A c= C & B is
  connected & Cl A meets Cl B holds B c= C

  proof

end;

theorem
  for B1,B2,V being Subset of GX holds Down(B1 \/ B2,V)=Down(B1,V) \/
  Down(B2,V)
proof
  let B1,B2,V be Subset of GX;
A1: Down(B2,V)=B2 /\ V by CONNSP_3:def 5;
  Down(B1 \/ B2,V)=(B1 \/ B2)/\ V & Down(B1,V)=B1 /\ V by CONNSP_3:def 5;

end;

theorem
  for B1,B2,V being Subset of GX holds Down(B1 /\ B2,V)=Down(B1,V) /\
  Down(B2,V)
proof
  let B1,B2,V be Subset of GX;
  Down(B1 /\ B2,V)=(B1 /\ B2)/\ V by CONNSP_3:def 5;
