theorem Th1: for A being Subset of GX, p being Point of GX st
 p in A & A is connected holds A c= skl p
proof let A be Subset of GX, p be Point of GX;

theorem   for A,B being Subset of GZ st A is_a_component_of GZ &

proof

       {A,B} c= bool (the carrier of GZ)

theorem   for B1,B2,V being Subset of GX

                             by CONNSP_3:def 5;
