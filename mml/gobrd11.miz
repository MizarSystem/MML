theorem Th1: for A being Subset of GX, p being Point of GX st
 p in A & A is connected holds A c= skl p
proof let A be Subset of GX, p be Point of GX;
 assume A1:p in A & A is connected;

reserve GZ for non empty TopSpace;

theorem for A,B being Subset of GZ st A is_a_component_of GZ &

proof
  let A,B be Subset of GZ;assume A1:A is_a_component_of GZ &
   B is_a_component_of GZ;
     {A,B} c= bool (the carrier of GZ)
    proof let x;assume x in {A,B}; then x=A or x=B by TARSKI:def 2;

end;

theorem for B1,B2,V being Subset of GX
 holds Down(B1 \/ B2,V)=Down(B1,V) \/ Down(B2,V)
proof let B1,B2,V be Subset of GX;
    Down(B1 \/ B2,V)=(B1 \/ B2)/\ V & Down(B1,V)=B1 /\ V & Down(B2,V)=B2 /\ V
                             by CONNSP_3:def 5;

theorem for B1,B2,V being Subset of GX

  A1:Down(B1 /\ B2,V)=(B1 /\ B2)/\ V & Down(B1,V)=B1 /\ V & Down(B2,V)=B2 /\ V
                             by CONNSP_3:def 5;
