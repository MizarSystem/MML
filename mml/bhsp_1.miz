    proof
      thus for a being real number for v,w being VECTOR of X0 holds a * (v + w

          .= a * v + b * v;
      end;
      thus for a,b being real number for v being VECTOR of X0 holds (a * b) *
      v = a * (b * v)
      proof
        let a,b be real number;
        let v be VECTOR of X0;
        reconsider v9= v as VECTOR of (0).V0;

A1: for x,y be VECTOR of X0 for x9,y9 be VECTOR of (0).V0 st x = x9 & y =
    y9 holds x + y= x9 + y9 & for a holds a * x = a * x9;
    thus for v,w being VECTOR of X0 holds v + w = w + v
    proof
      let v,w be VECTOR of X0;
      reconsider v9= v, w9= w as VECTOR of (0).V0;

    proof
      let v be VECTOR of X0;
      reconsider v9= v as VECTOR of (0).V0;
      thus v + 0.X0 = v9+ 0.(0).V0 .=v by RLVECT_1:10;

      consider w9 be VECTOR of (0).V0 such that
