theorem
  for L being LATTICE holds L is modular iff not ex K being full
  Sublattice of L st N_5,K are_isomorphic
proof
  let L be LATTICE;
  thus L is modular implies not ex K being full Sublattice of L st N_5,K
  are_isomorphic
  proof
    assume L is modular;

  let L be LATTICE;
  assume
A1: L is modular;
  now
    given a,b,c,d,e being Element of L such that
