:: The aim of this article is to formalize the well known construction of
:: the projective closure of an affine space. We begin with some evident
:: properties of planes in affine planes.

theorem Th1: AS is AffinPlane & X=the carrier of AS implies X is_plane
proof assume that A1: AS is AffinPlane and A2: X=the carrier of AS;
consider a,b,c being Element of AS such that
A3: not LIN a,b,c by AFF_1:21;
A4: a<>b & a<>c by A3,AFF_1:16; set P=Line(a,b),K=Line(a,c);
A5: a in P & a in K & b in P & c in K & P is_line & K is_line
 by A4,AFF_1:26,def 3;
A6: not K // P proof assume K // P;
 then c in P by A5,AFF_1:59; hence contradiction by A3,A5,AFF_1:33; end;
set Y=Plane(K,P);
A7: Y is_plane by A5,A6,AFF_4:def 2;
     now let x; assume x in X;
 then reconsider a=x as Element of AS; set K'=a*K;
  A8: K' is_line & K // K' & a in K' by A5,AFF_4:27,def 3;
  then not K' // P by A6,AFF_1:58;
  then consider b being Element of AS such that
  A9: b in K' & b in P by A1,A5,A8,AFF_1:72;
   a,b // K by A8,A9,AFF_1:54;
then a in {zz: ex b being Element
     of AS st zz,b // K & b in P} by A9;
 hence x in Y by AFF_4:def 1; end; then X c= Y by TARSKI:def 3;
hence thesis by A2,A7,XBOOLE_0:def 10; end;

theorem Th2:
  AS is AffinPlane & X is_plane implies X = the carrier of AS
proof
 assume that A1: AS is AffinPlane and A2: X is_plane;
      the carrier of AS c= the carrier of AS;
 then reconsider Z=the carrier of AS as Subset of AS;
      X c= Z & Z is_plane by A1,Th1;
 hence thesis by A2,AFF_4:33;
end;

theorem Th3: AS is AffinPlane & X is_plane & Y is_plane implies X=Y
proof assume AS is AffinPlane & X is_plane & Y is_plane;
then X=the carrier of AS & Y=the carrier of AS by Th2; hence thesis; end;

theorem    X=the carrier of AS & X is_plane implies AS is AffinPlane
proof assume that A1: X=the carrier of AS and A2: X is_plane;
 assume AS is not AffinPlane; then ex zz st not zz in X by A2,AFF_4:48;
hence contradiction by A1; end;

theorem Th5:
 not A // K & A '||' X & A '||' Y & K '||' X & K '||' Y & A is_line &
 K is_line & X is_plane & Y is_plane implies X '||' Y
proof assume that
A1: not A // K and
A2:A '||' X & A '||' Y & K '||' X & K '||' Y and
A3: A is_line & K is_line & X is_plane & Y is_plane;
A4: X <> {} & Y <> {} by A3,AFF_4:59;
consider x being Element of X;
consider y being Element of Y;
reconsider a=x,b=y as Element of AS by A4,TARSKI:def 3;
      a*A c= a+X & a*K c= a+X & b*A c= b+Y & b*K c= b+Y by A2,A3,AFF_4:68;
then A5: a*A c= X & a*K c= X & b*A c= Y & b*K c= Y by A3,A4,AFF_4:66;
A6: A // a*A & A // b*A & K // a*K & K // b*K by A3,AFF_4:def 3;
A7: not a*A // a*K proof assume not thesis; then a*A // K by A6,AFF_1:58;
 hence contradiction by A1,A6,AFF_1:58; end;
     a*A // b*A & a*K // b*K by A6,AFF_1:58;
hence X '||' Y by A3,A5,A7,AFF_4:55;end;

theorem Th6:
 X is_plane & A '||' X & X '||' Y implies A '||' Y by AFF_4:59,60;

:: Next we distinguish two sets, one consisting of the lines, the second
:: consisting of the planes of a given affine space and we consider two
:: equivalence relations defined on each of these sets; theses relations
:: are in fact the relation of parallelity restricted to suitable area.
:: Their equivalence classes are called directions (of lines and planes,
:: respectively); they are intended to be considered as new objects which
:: extend the given affine space to a projective space.

A16: Line(a,b) c= Y & Line(a,c) c= Y & Line(a,d) c= Y
 proof
 thus Line(a,b) c= Y & Line(a,c) c= Y by A14;
      Line(b,d)=b*Line(a,c) by A6,A11,A12,AFF_4:def 3; then Line(b,d) c= Y by

  A21: now assume q on L1 or r on L1; then d in Line(a,b) or c in Line(a,b)

        now assume p on R1 or r on R1; then a in Line(b,d) or c in
