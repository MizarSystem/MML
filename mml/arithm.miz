reserve x for complex number;

theorem Th1:
  x + 0 = x
proof
  x in COMPLEX by XCMPLX_0:def 2;
  then consider x1,x2 being Element of REAL such that
A1: x = [*x1,x2*] by ARYTM_0:11;
  0 = [*0,0*] by ARYTM_0:def 7;
  then x + 0 = [*+(x1,0),+(x2,0)*] by A1,XCMPLX_0:def 4
    .= [* x1,+(x2,0)*] by ARYTM_0:13
    .= x by A1,ARYTM_0:13;
  hence thesis;
end;

Lm1: -0 = 0
proof
  0 + -0 = -0 by Th1;
  hence thesis by XCMPLX_0:def 6;
end;

Lm2: opp 0 = 0
proof
  +(0,0) = 0 by ARYTM_0:13;
  hence thesis by ARYTM_0:def 4;
end;

theorem Th2:
  x * 0 = 0
proof
  x in COMPLEX by XCMPLX_0:def 2;
  then consider x1,x2 being Element of REAL such that
A1: x = [*x1,x2*] by ARYTM_0:11;
  0 = [*0,0*] by ARYTM_0:def 7;
  then x * 0 = [* +(*(x1,0),opp*(x2,0)), +(*(x1,0),*(x2,0)) *] by A1,
  XCMPLX_0:def 5
    .= [* +(*(x1,0),opp 0), +(*(x1,0),*(x2,0)) *] by ARYTM_0:14
    .= [* +(*(x1,0),opp 0), +(*(x1,0),0) *] by ARYTM_0:14
    .= [* +(0,opp 0), +(*(x1,0),0) *] by ARYTM_0:14
    .= [* +(0,opp 0), +(0,0) *] by ARYTM_0:14
    .= [* +(0,opp 0), 0 *] by ARYTM_0:13
    .= [* opp 0, 0 *] by ARYTM_0:13
    .= 0 by Lm2,ARYTM_0:def 7;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th3:
  1 * x = x
proof
  x in COMPLEX by XCMPLX_0:def 2;
  then consider x1,x2 being Element of REAL such that
A1: x = [*x1,x2*] by ARYTM_0:11;
  1 = [*1,0*] by ARYTM_0:def 7;
  then x * 1 = [* +(*(x1,1),opp*(x2,0)), +(*(x1,0),*(x2,1)) *] by A1,
  XCMPLX_0:def 5
    .= [* +(*(x1,1),opp 0), +(*(x1,0),*(x2,1)) *] by ARYTM_0:14
    .= [* +(x1,opp 0), +(*(x1,0),*(x2,1)) *] by ARYTM_0:21
    .= [* +(x1,opp 0), +(*(x1,0),x2) *] by ARYTM_0:21
    .= [* +(x1,0), +(0,x2) *] by Lm2,ARYTM_0:14
    .= [* x1, +(0,x2) *] by ARYTM_0:13
    .= x by A1,ARYTM_0:13;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem
  x - 0 = x
proof
  x - 0 = x + 0 by Lm1,XCMPLX_0:def 8;
  hence thesis by Th1;
end;

theorem
  0 / x = 0
proof
  0 / x = 0 * x" by XCMPLX_0:def 9;
  hence thesis by Th2;
end;

Lm3: 1" = 1
proof
  1 * 1" = 1" by Th3;
  hence thesis by XCMPLX_0:def 7;
end;

theorem
  x / 1 = x
proof
  x / 1 = x * 1 by Lm3,XCMPLX_0:def 9;
  hence thesis by Th3;
end;
