theorem Th3:
  dom x = Seg n
 proof
  len x = n by Th2; hence thesis by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
 end;

theorem Th4:
  x.k in REAL
 proof
  per cases;
  suppose A1: k in Seg n;
  len x = n by Th2;
  then Seg n = dom x by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  hence thesis by A1,FINSEQ_2:13;
  end;
  suppose not k in Seg n;
  then not k in dom x by Th3;
  then x.k = 0 by FUNCT_1:def 4;
  hence thesis;
 end;
 end;

theorem Th5:
  (for k st k in Seg n holds x1.k = x2.k) implies x1 = x2 by FINSEQ_2:139;

Lm1: dom abs x = dom x

  then dom abs x = Seg n by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  hence thesis by Th3;
end;

theorem Th6:
   r = x.k implies (abs x).k = abs r
 proof assume that
A1:  r = x.k;
  per cases;
  suppose A2: k in Seg n;
     len abs x = n by FINSEQ_2:109;
  then absreal*x = abs x & k in dom abs x by A2,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  hence (abs x).k = absreal.r by A1,FUNCT_1:22 .= abs r by Def2;
  end;
  suppose not k in Seg n;
then A3: not k in dom x by Th3;
then A4: not k in dom abs x by Lm1;
A5: r = {} by A1,A3,FUNCT_1:def 4;

  hence thesis by A5,ABSVALUE:def 1;
 end;
 end;

Lm2: sqr abs x = sqr x
proof
     now let k; assume k in Seg n;
    thus (sqr abs x).k = ((abs x).k)^2 by RVSUM_1:79
      .= (abs (x.k))^2 by Th6
      .= (x.k)^2 by COMPLEX1:161
      .= (sqr x).k by RVSUM_1:78;

theorem  abs 0*n = n |-> (0 qua Real)
proof

end;

theorem Th8:
  abs -x = abs x
 proof
     now let j such that
      j in Seg n;
   reconsider r = x.j, r' = (-x).j as Element of REAL by Th4;
   thus (abs -x).j = abs r' by Th6

theorem Th9:
   abs(r*x) = abs(r)*(abs x)
 proof
     now let j such that
A1:  j in Seg n;
   reconsider r' = x.j, rr = (r*x).j as Element of REAL by Th4;
      len abs x = n by FINSEQ_2:109;
   then Seg n = dom (abs x) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
   then reconsider ar = (abs x).j as Real by A1,FINSEQ_2:13;
A2: r is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
   thus (abs(r*x)).j = abs(rr) by Th6
                    .= abs(r*r') by A2,RVSUM_1:66
                    .= abs(r)*abs(r') by COMPLEX1:151

  end;
  hence thesis by FINSEQ_2:139;
 end;

theorem Th10: |.0*n.| = 0
 proof
   thus |.0*n .| = sqrt Sum sqr 0*n

 end;

theorem Th11: |.x.| = 0 implies x = 0*n
 proof assume
A1:  |.x.| = 0;
     now let j; assume
A2:  j in Seg n;
   reconsider r = x.j as Element of REAL by Th4;
      0 <= Sum sqr x & sqrt Sum sqr x = 0 by A1,RVSUM_1:116;
   then Sum sqr x = 0 by SQUARE_1:92;
   then Sum sqr abs x = 0 by Lm2;
   then (abs x).j = (n|->0).j by RVSUM_1:121;
   then abs r = (n|-> 0).j by Th6;
   then abs r = 0 by A2,FINSEQ_2:70;
   then r = 0 by ABSVALUE:7;
   hence x.j = (n|->(0 qua Real)).j by A2,FINSEQ_2:70;
  end;
  then x = n|->(0 qua Real) by Th5;
  hence thesis;
 end;

theorem Th12: |.x.| >= 0
 proof
     |.x.| = sqrt Sum sqr x & 0 <= Sum sqr x by RVSUM_1:116;
  hence thesis by SQUARE_1:def 4;
 end;

theorem Th13: |.-x.| = |.x.|
 proof
   thus |.-x.| = sqrt Sum sqr -x
            .= sqrt Sum sqr abs -x by Lm2
            .= sqrt Sum sqr abs x by Th8
            .= sqrt Sum sqr x by Lm2
            .= |.x.|;
 end;

theorem Th14: |.r*x.| = abs(r)*|.x.|
 proof
A1:   0 <= (abs(r))^2 & 0 <= Sum sqr abs x by RVSUM_1:116,SQUARE_1:72;
A2:   0 <= abs(r) by COMPLEX1:132;
   thus |.r*x.| = sqrt Sum sqr (r*x)
         .= sqrt Sum sqr abs(r*x) by Lm2
         .= sqrt Sum sqr (abs(r)*abs x) by Th9

theorem Th61: x*p = |[ x*p`1 ,x*p`2 ]|
 proof
  reconsider p1=p as Element of REAL 2;
  A1: x*p = x*p1 by Def11;
  A2: p`1 = p1.1 & p`2 = p1.2 by Def14,Def15;
A3: x is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
  A4: (x*p)`1 = (x*p1).1 by A1,Def14 .= x*(p`1)
     by A2,A3,RVSUM_1:66;
     (x*p)`2 = (x*p1).2 by A1,Def15 .= x*(p`2) by A2,A3,RVSUM_1:66;
  hence x*p = |[ x*p`1, x*p`2]| by A4,Th57;
 end;

theorem  x*|[x1,y1]| = |[ x*x1 ,x*y1 ]|
 proof
     |[x1,y1]|`1 = x1 & |[x1,y1]|`2 = y1 by Th56;
  hence thesis by Th61;
 end;

theorem Th63: -p = |[ -p`1, -p`2]|
 proof
  thus -p = (-1)*p by Th43 .= |[ (-1)*p`1, (-1)*p`2]| by Th61
     .= |[ -p`1, -p`2]|;
 end;

theorem  -|[x1,y1]| = |[ -x1, -y1]|
 proof
     |[x1,y1]|`1 = x1 & |[x1,y1]|`2 = y1 by Th56;
  hence thesis by Th63;
 end;

theorem Th65: p1 - p2 = |[ p1`1 - p2`1, p1`2 - p2`2]|
 proof
     -p2 = |[ -p2`1, -p2`2]| by Th63;
  then A1: (-p2)`1 = -p2`1 & (-p2)`2 = -p2`2 by Th56;
  thus p1 - p2 = p1 + -p2 by Th45 .= |[ p1`1 + -p2`1, p1`2 + -p2`2]| by A1,Th59
              .= |[ p1`1 - p2`1, p1`2 - p2`2]|;
 end;

theorem  |[x1, y1]| - |[x2, y2]| = |[ x1 - x2, y1 - y2]|
 proof
     |[x1, y1]|`1 = x1 & |[x1, y1]|`2 = y1 & |[x2, y2]|`1 = x2 & |[x2, y2]|`2 =
y2
   by Th56;
  hence thesis by Th65;
