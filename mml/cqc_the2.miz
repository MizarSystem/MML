theorem Th1:
  p => (q => r) is valid implies (p '&' q) => r is valid
proof
A1: (p => (q => r)) => ((p '&' q) => r) in TAUT by PROCAL_1:32;
  assume
  p => (q => r) in TAUT;
  hence (p '&' q) => r in TAUT by A1,CQC_THE1:82;
end;

theorem Th2:
  p => (q => r) is valid implies (q '&' p) => r is valid
proof
  assume
  p => (q => r) in TAUT;
  then p => (q => r) is valid by CQC_THE1:def 11;
  then (p '&' q) => r is valid by Th1;
  then
A1: (p '&' q) => r in TAUT by CQC_THE1:def 11;
  q '&' p => p '&' q in TAUT by CQC_THE1:81;
  hence (q '&' p) => r in TAUT by A1,LUKASI_1:3;
end;

theorem Th3:
  (p '&' q) => r is valid implies p => (q => r) is valid
proof
A1: ((p '&' q) => r) => (p => (q => r)) in TAUT by PROCAL_1:31;
  assume
  (p '&' q) => r in TAUT;
  hence (p => (q => r)) in TAUT by A1,CQC_THE1:82;
end;

theorem Th4:
  (p '&' q) => r is valid implies q => (p => r) is valid
proof
A1: q '&' p => p '&' q in TAUT by CQC_THE1:81;
  assume
  (p '&' q) => r in TAUT;
  then q '&' p => r in TAUT by A1,LUKASI_1:3;
  then q '&' p => r is valid by CQC_THE1:def 11;
  then q => (p => r) is valid by Th3;
  hence q => (p => r) in TAUT by CQC_THE1:def 11;
end;

Lm1: (p '&' q) => p is valid & (p '&' q) => q is valid
proof
  thus (p '&' q) => p in TAUT & (p '&' q) => q in TAUT by PROCAL_1:19,21;
end;

Lm2: p '&' q is valid implies p is valid & q is valid
proof
  assume
A1: p '&' q is valid;
  (p '&' q) => p is valid & (p '&' q) => q is valid by Lm1;
  hence thesis by A1,CQC_THE1:104;
end;

Lm3: p => q is valid & p => r is valid implies p => q '&' r is valid
proof
  assume
  p => q in TAUT & p => r in TAUT;
  hence p => q '&' r in TAUT by PROCAL_1:52;
end;

Lm4: p => q is valid & r => t is valid implies p 'or' r => q 'or' t is valid
proof
  assume
  p => q in TAUT & r => t in TAUT;
  hence p 'or' r => q 'or' t in TAUT by PROCAL_1:57;
end;

Lm5: p => q is valid & r => t is valid implies p '&' r => q '&' t is valid
proof
  assume
  p => q in TAUT & r => t in TAUT;
  hence p '&' r => q '&' t in TAUT by PROCAL_1:56;
end;

Lm6: p => p 'or' q is valid & p => q 'or' p is valid
proof
  thus p => p 'or' q in TAUT & p => q 'or' p in TAUT by PROCAL_1:3,4;
end;

Lm7: p => q is valid & r => q is valid implies (p 'or' r) => q is valid
proof
  assume

end;

Lm8: p is valid & q is valid implies p '&' q is valid
proof
  assume
  p in TAUT & q in TAUT;

end;

Lm9: p => q is valid implies r '&' p => r '&' q is valid
proof
  assume
  p => q in TAUT;
  hence r '&' p => r '&' q in TAUT by PROCAL_1:50;
end;

Lm10: p => q is valid implies p 'or' r => q 'or' r is valid
proof
  assume
  p => q in TAUT;
  hence p 'or' r => q 'or' r in TAUT by PROCAL_1:48;
end;

Lm11: p 'or' q => ('not' p => q) is valid
proof
  thus ( p 'or' q ) => ( 'not' p => q ) in TAUT by PROCAL_1:5;
end;

Lm12: ('not' p => q) => (p 'or' q) is valid
proof
  'not' 'not' p => p in TAUT by LUKASI_1:25;

  then
  ('not' p => q) => ('not' 'not' p 'or' q) in TAUT & 'not' 'not' p 'or' q
  => p 'or' q in TAUT by PROCAL_1:14,48;

  hence ('not' p => q) => (p 'or' q) in TAUT by LUKASI_1:3;
end;

Lm13: p <=> p is valid
proof
  p => p is valid by LUKASI_1:44;
  then (p => p) '&' (p => p) is valid by Lm8;
  hence thesis by QC_LANG2:def 4;
end;

Lm14: p => q is valid & q => p is valid iff p <=> q is valid
proof
  thus p => q is valid & q => p is valid implies p <=> q is valid
  proof
    assume
    p => q is valid & q => p is valid;
    then (p => q) '&' (q => p) is valid by Lm8;
    hence thesis by QC_LANG2:def 4;
  end;
  assume
  p <=> q is valid;
  then (p => q) '&' (q => p) is valid by QC_LANG2:def 4;
  hence thesis by Lm2;
end;

Lm15: p <=> q is valid implies ( p is valid iff q is valid)
proof
  assume
A1: p <=> q in TAUT;
  (p <=> q) => (p => q) in TAUT by PROCAL_1:23;
  then
A2: p => q in TAUT by A1,CQC_THE1:82;
  thus p is valid implies q is valid
  proof
    assume
    p in TAUT;
    hence q in TAUT by A2,CQC_THE1:82;
  end;
  assume
A3: q in TAUT;
  (p <=> q) => (q => p) in TAUT by PROCAL_1:24;
  then q => p in TAUT by A1,CQC_THE1:82;
  hence p in TAUT by A3,CQC_THE1:82;
end;

Lm16: p => (q => r) is valid & r => t is valid implies p => (q => t) is valid
proof
  assume that
A1: p => (q => r) is valid and
A2: r => t is valid;
  (p '&' q) => r is valid by A1,Th1;
  then (p '&' q) => t is valid by A2,LUKASI_1:43;
