begin

reserve a, b, d1, d2 for Data-Location,
        il, i1, i2 for Instruction-Location of SCM,
        I for Instruction of SCM,
        s, s1, s2 for State of SCM,
        T for InsType of SCM,
        k for natural number;

theorem Th1:
 not a in the Instruction-Locations of SCM
  proof
      a in SCM-Data-Loc by AMI_3:def 2;
    hence thesis by AMI_3:def 1,AMI_5:33,XBOOLE_0:3;
  end;

theorem Th2:
 SCM-Data-Loc <> the Instruction-Locations of SCM
  proof
    assume
A1:   not thesis;
    consider a being Element of SCM-Instr-Loc;
    a in SCM-Instr-Loc;
    hence thesis by A1,AMI_2:12,AMI_3:def 1;
  end;

theorem Th3:
 for o being Object of SCM holds
  o = IC SCM or o in the Instruction-Locations of SCM or
  o is Data-Location
  proof
    let o be Object of SCM;
      o in {IC SCM} \/ SCM-Data-Loc or o in SCM-Instr-Loc
      by AMI_5:23,XBOOLE_0:def 2;
    then o in {IC SCM} or o in SCM-Data-Loc or o in SCM-Instr-Loc by XBOOLE_0:
def 2;
    hence thesis by AMI_3:def 1,def 2,TARSKI:def 1;
  end;

theorem Th4:
 i1 <> i2 implies Next i1 <> Next i2
  proof
    assume
A1:   i1 <> i2 & Next i1 = Next i2;
    consider m1 being Element of SCM-Instr-Loc such that
A2:   m1 = i1 & Next i1 = Next m1 by AMI_3:def 11;
    consider m2 being Element of SCM-Instr-Loc such that
A3:   m2 = i2 & Next i2 = Next m2 by AMI_3:def 11;
    Next m1 = m1+2 & Next m2 = m2+2 by AMI_2:def 15;
    hence contradiction by A1,A2,A3,XCMPLX_1:2;
  end;

theorem Th5:
 s1,s2 equal_outside the Instruction-Locations of SCM implies s1.a = s2.a
  proof
    set IL = the Instruction-Locations of SCM;
    assume
A1:   s1,s2 equal_outside IL;
A2: dom s1 = the carrier of SCM by AMI_3:36;
A3: dom s2 = the carrier of SCM by AMI_3:36;
A4: not a in IL by Th1;
    then a in dom s1 \ IL by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A5: a in dom s1 /\ (dom s1 \ IL) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      a in dom s2 \ IL by A3,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
then A6: a in dom s2 /\ (dom s2 \ IL) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    thus s1.a = (s1|(dom s1 \ IL)).a by A5,FUNCT_1:71
             .= (s2|(dom s2 \ IL)).a by A1,FUNCT_7:def 2
             .= s2.a by A6,FUNCT_1:71;
  end;

theorem Th6:
 for N being with_non-empty_elements set,
     S being realistic IC-Ins-separated definite
       (non empty non void AMI-Struct over N),
     t, u being State of S,
     il being Instruction-Location of S,
     e being Element of ObjectKind IC S,
     I being Element of ObjectKind il
  st e = il & u = t+*((IC S, il)-->(e, I))
  holds
    u.il = I &
    IC u = il &
    IC Following u = Exec(u.IC u, u).IC S
  proof
    let N be with_non-empty_elements set,
        S be realistic IC-Ins-separated definite
          (non empty non void AMI-Struct over N),
        t, u be State of S,
        il be Instruction-Location of S,
        e be Element of ObjectKind IC S,
        I be Element of ObjectKind il such that
A1:  e = il and
A2:  u = t+*((IC S, il)-->(e, I));
     A3: dom ((IC S, il)-->(e, I)) = {IC S, il} by FUNCT_4:65;
     then A4: IC S in dom ((IC S, il)-->(e, I)) by TARSKI:def 2;
     A5: IC S <> il by AMI_1:48;
       il in dom ((IC S, il)-->(e, I)) by A3,TARSKI:def 2;
         hence
        u.il = ((IC S, il)-->(e, I)).il by A2,FUNCT_4:14
             .= I by A5,FUNCT_4:66;
         thus
        IC u = u.IC S by AMI_1:def 15
             .= ((IC S, il)-->(e, I)).IC S by A2,A4,FUNCT_4:14
             .= il by A1,A5,FUNCT_4:66;
         thus
           IC Following u = IC Exec(CurInstr u,u) by AMI_1:def 18
           .= IC Exec(u.IC u, u) by AMI_1:def 17
           .= Exec(u.IC u, u).IC S by AMI_1:def 15;
  end;

Lm1:
 for x, y being set st x in dom <*y*> holds x = 1
  proof
    let x, y be set;

  end;

Lm3:
 T = 0 or T = 1 or T = 2 or T = 3 or T = 4 or T = 5 or T = 6 or T = 7 or T = 8
  proof
      T in Segm 9 by AMI_3:def 1;
    then reconsider t = T as Nat;
      t = 0 or t < 8+1 by AMI_3:def 1,GR_CY_1:10;
    then t = 0 or t <= 8 by NAT_1:38;
    hence thesis by CQC_THE1:9;
  end;

theorem Th7:

       .= {} by AMI_3:71,MCART_1:def 2;
  end;

theorem Th8:
 AddressPart (a:=b) = <*a,b*>

       .= <*a,b*> by MCART_1:def 2;
  end;

theorem Th9:
 AddressPart AddTo(a,b) = <*a,b*>

       .= <*a,b*> by MCART_1:def 2;
  end;

       .= <*i1*> by MCART_1:def 2;
  end;

theorem Th14:
 AddressPart (a=0_goto i1) = <*i1,a*>

       .= [ 7, <*i1,a*>]`2 by AMI_3:def 9
       .= <*i1,a*> by MCART_1:def 2;
  end;

theorem Th15:
 AddressPart (a>0_goto i1) = <*i1,a*>
