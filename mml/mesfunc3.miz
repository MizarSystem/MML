 A1: P[0]
 proof
 now
 let m be Nat, a be Function of [: Seg 0, Seg m :],REAL;
 let p,q be FinSequence of REAL such that
        A2:  dom p=Seg 0 and
           for i be Nat st i in dom p
                holds ex r be FinSequence of REAL st
                     (dom(r) = Seg m & p.i=Sum(r)
                     & for j be Nat st j in dom(r) holds r.j=a.[i,j]) and
        A3:  dom q=Seg m and
        A4:for j be Nat st j in dom q
              holds ex s be FinSequence of REAL st
                     (dom(s) = Seg 0 & q.j=Sum(s)
                     & for i be Nat st i in dom(s) holds s.i=a.[i,j] );
thus Sum(p)=Sum(q)
proof
 len p = 0 by A2,FINSEQ_1:def 3; then
 A5: Sum(p)=0 by FINSEQ_1:32,RVSUM_1:102;
 A6: q = dom q --> 0
    proof
     now let z be set;
     assume
     A7: z in dom q;
        z in { k where k is Nat : 1 <= k & k <= m }
        by A3,A7,FINSEQ_1:def 1; then
        consider k be Nat such that
            A8:z=k & 1 <= k & k <= m;
          reconsider j=z as Nat by A8;
        consider s be FinSequence of REAL such that
           A9: dom(s) = Seg 0 and
           A10: q.j=Sum(s) and
            for i be Nat st i in dom(s) holds s.i=a.[i,j] by A4,A7;
          len s = 0 by A9,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
          hence q.z=0 by A10,FINSEQ_1:32,RVSUM_1:102;
         end;
    hence q = dom q --> 0 by FUNCOP_1:17;
    end;
    q= m |-> 0 by A3,A6,FINSEQ_2:def 2;
 hence Sum(p)=Sum(q) by A5,RVSUM_1:111;
 end;
end;
 hence thesis;
