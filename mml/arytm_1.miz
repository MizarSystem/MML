reserve x,y,z for Element of REAL+;

theorem Th1:
 x + y = y implies x = {}
proof reconsider o = {} as Element of REAL+ by ARYTM_2:21;
 assume x + y = y;
  then x + y = y + o by ARYTM_2:def 8;
 hence x = {} by ARYTM_2:12;
end;

reconsider u = one as Element of REAL+ by ARYTM_2:21;

Lm1:
 x *' y = x *' z & x <> {} implies y = z
proof assume
A1: x *' y = x *' z;
 assume x <> {};
  then consider x1 being Element of REAL+ such that
A2: x *' x1 = one by ARYTM_2:15;
 thus y = x *' x1 *' y by A2,ARYTM_2:16
     .= x1 *' (x *' z) by A1,ARYTM_2:13
     .= x *' x1 *' z by ARYTM_2:13
     .= z by A2,ARYTM_2:16;
end;

theorem
   x *' y = {} implies x = {} or y = {}
proof assume
A1: x *' y = {};
 assume x <> {};
  then consider x1 being Element of REAL+ such that
A2: x *' x1 = one by ARYTM_2:15;
 thus y = x *' x1 *' y by A2,ARYTM_2:16
    .= x *' y *' x1 by ARYTM_2:13
    .= {} by A1,ARYTM_2:4;
end;

theorem Th3:
 x <=' y & y <=' z implies x <=' z
proof
 assume x <=' y;
 then consider z1 being Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x + z1 = y by ARYTM_2:10;
 assume y <=' z;
 then consider z2 being Element of REAL+ such that
A2: y + z2 = z by ARYTM_2:10;
    z = x + (z1 + z2) by A1,A2,ARYTM_2:7;
 hence x <=' z by ARYTM_2:20;
end;

theorem Th4:
 x <=' y & y <=' x implies x = y
proof
 assume x <=' y;
 then consider z1 being Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x + z1 = y by ARYTM_2:10;
 assume y <=' x;
 then consider z2 being Element of REAL+ such that
A2: y + z2 = x by ARYTM_2:10;
    x = x + (z1 + z2) by A1,A2,ARYTM_2:7;
  then z1 + z2 = {} by Th1;
  then z1 = {} by ARYTM_2:6;
 hence x = y by A1,ARYTM_2:def 8;
end;

theorem Th5:
 x <=' y & y = {} implies x = {}
proof
 assume x <=' y;
 then consider z being Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x + z = y by ARYTM_2:10;
 thus thesis by A1,ARYTM_2:6;
end;

theorem Th6:
 x = {} implies x <=' y
proof assume x = {};
  then x + y = y by ARYTM_2:def 8;
 hence x <=' y by ARYTM_2:20;
end;

theorem Th7:
 x <=' y iff x + z <=' y + z
proof
 thus x <=' y implies x + z <=' y + z
  proof
   assume x <=' y;
   then consider z0 being Element of REAL+ such that
A1:  x + z0 = y by ARYTM_2:10;
      x + z + z0 = y + z by A1,ARYTM_2:7;
   hence thesis by ARYTM_2:20;
  end;
 assume x + z <=' y + z;
 then consider z0 being Element of REAL+ such that
A2: x + z + z0 = y + z by ARYTM_2:10;
    y + z = x + z0 + z by A2,ARYTM_2:7;
  then y = x + z0 by ARYTM_2:12;
 hence thesis by ARYTM_2:20;
end;

theorem Th8:
 x <=' y implies x *' z <=' y *' z
proof
 assume x <=' y;
 then consider z0 being Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x + z0 = y by ARYTM_2:10;
    y *' z = x *' z + z0 *' z by A1,ARYTM_2:14;
 hence thesis by ARYTM_2:20;
end;

Lm2: x *' y <=' x *' z & x <> {} implies y <=' z
proof
 assume x *' y <=' x *' z;
 then consider z0 being Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x *' y + z0 = x *' z by ARYTM_2:10;
 assume
A2: x <> {};
  then consider x1 being Element of REAL+ such that
A3: x *' x1 = one by ARYTM_2:15;
    x *' z = x *' y + u *' z0 by A1,ARYTM_2:16
   .= x *' y + x *' (x1 *' z0) by A3,ARYTM_2:13
   .= x *' (y + x1 *' z0) by ARYTM_2:14;
  then z = y + x1 *' z0 by A2,Lm1;
 hence thesis by ARYTM_2:20;
end;

definition let x,y be Element of REAL+;
 func x -' y -> Element of REAL+ means
:Def1: it + y = x if y <=' x
  otherwise it = {};
 existence
  proof
   hereby assume y <=' x;
     then ex IT being Element of REAL+ st y + IT = x by ARYTM_2:10;
    hence ex IT being Element of REAL+ st IT + y = x;
   end;
   thus thesis by ARYTM_2:21;
  end;
 correctness by ARYTM_2:12;
end;
