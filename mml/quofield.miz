proof
let I be domRing-like commutative Ring;
let F,F' be add-associative right_zeroed right_complementable
    Abelian commutative associative left_unital distributive
      Field-like non degenerated (non empty doubleLoopStr);
let f be map of I, F;
let f' be map of I, F';
assume A1: I has_Field_of_Quotients_Pair F,f &
           I has_Field_of_Quotients_Pair F',f';
then A2: f is RingMonomorphism by Def29;
A3: f' is RingMonomorphism by A1,Def29;
then consider h1 being map of F, F' such that

    for h' being map of F, F'
        st h' is RingHomomorphism & h'*f = f'
        holds h' = h1 by A1,Def29;
consider h2 being map of F', F such that
A5: h2 is RingHomomorphism &
    h2*f' = f & for h' being map of F', F
        st h' is RingHomomorphism & h'*f' = f
        holds h' = h2 by A1,A2,Def29;
A6: (h2 * h1) * f = f by A4,A5,RELAT_1:55;
A7: h2 * h1 is RingHomomorphism by A4,A5,Th57;
A8: id F * f = f by GRCAT_1:12;
consider h3 being map of F, F such that
A9: h3 is RingHomomorphism & h3*f = f &
    for h' being map of F, F st h' is RingHomomorphism & h'*f = f
        holds h' = h3 by A1,A2,Def29;
     (h2 * h1) = h3 by A6,A7,A9
          .= id F by A8,A9
          .= id the carrier of F by GRCAT_1:def 11;
then h1 is one-to-one by FUNCT_2:37;
then A10: h1 is RingMonomorphism by A4,Def23;

         holds h' = h3 by A1,A3,Def29;
     h1 * h2 = h3 by A11,A12,A14
        .= id F' by A13,A14
        .= id the carrier of F' by GRCAT_1:def 11;
then rng h1 = the carrier of F' by FUNCT_2:24;
then h1 is RingEpimorphism by A4,Def22;
