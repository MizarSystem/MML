for f being FinSequence
  holds 1 <= n & n+1 <= len f iff n in dom f & n+1 in dom f
 proof let n be Nat; let f be FinSequence;
  thus 1<=n & n+1 <= len f implies n in dom f & n+1 in dom f
   proof assume
    A1: 1<=n & n+1 <= len f;
        n<=n+1 by NAT_1:11;
    then 1<=n+1 & n<=len f by A1,XXREAL_0:2;

for f being FinSequence
  holds 1 <= n & n+2 <= len f iff n in dom f & n+1 in dom f & n+2 in dom f
 proof let n be Nat;let f be FinSequence;
  thus 1<=n & n+2 <= len f implies n in dom f & n+1 in dom f & n+2 in dom f
   proof assume

A1: 1 <= n and
A2: n <= len f2;
A3: len f1 < n + len f1 by A1,NAT_1:19;
        len(f1^f2) = len f1 + len f2 by FINSEQ_1:35;
then A4: n + len f1 <= len(f1^f2) by A2,XREAL_1:8;
      n + len f1 >= n by NAT_1:11;
  then n + len f1 >= 1 by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
