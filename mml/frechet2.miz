  proof
    let p be Point of T;
        Cl({p}) = {p} by A1;
    hence {p} is closed by PRE_TOPC:52;

A3: not x2 in {x1} by PRE_TOPC:48,TARSKI:def 3;
  reconsider x2 as Point of T by A2;

  thus S is_convergent_to x2
  proof
    let U1 be Subset of T;
    assume U1 is open & x2 in U1;
    then {x1} meets U1 by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 13;

A1:
  rng NS c= NAT by SEQM_3:def 8;

  consider NS being increasing Seq_of_Nat such that
A3: S1=S*NS by Def1;
  reconsider x as Nat by A1,NORMSP_1:17;
