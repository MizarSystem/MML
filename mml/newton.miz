reserve k,n,n1,n2,m1,m2 for natural number;

theorem Th106:
  r <> 0 or n = 0 iff r|^n <> 0
proof
  defpred P[Nat] means r <> 0 or $1 = 0 iff r|^$1 <> 0;
A1: P[k] implies P[k+1]
  proof
    assume
A2: P[k];
    r|^(k+1) = r|^k*r by Th11;
    hence thesis by A2;
  end;
A3: P[0] by RVSUM_1:124;
  P[k] from NAT_1:sch 2(A3,A1);
  hence thesis;

Lm4: (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1) implies n1 <= n2
proof
  assume
A1: (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1);
  assume
A2: n1 > n2;
  then consider n being Nat such that
A3: n1 = n2+n by NAT_1:10;
  n <> 0 by A2,A3;
  then consider k being Nat such that
A4: n = k+1 by NAT_1:6;
A5: 2|^n2 <> 0 by Th106;
  reconsider k as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 13;
  2|^n1 = (2|^n2)*(2|^(k+1)) by A3,A4,Th13;
  then (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = 2|^n2*(2|^(k+1)*(2*m1+1));
  then 2|^(k+1)*(2*m1+1) = 2*m2+1 by A1,A5,XCMPLX_1:5;
  then 2*m2+1 = 2|^k*(2|^1)*(2*m1+1) by Th13
    .= 2*(2|^k)*(2*m1+1) by Th10
    .= 2*((2|^k)*(2*m1+1));
  then
A6: 2 divides 2*m2+1 by NAT_D:def 3;
  2 divides 2*m2 by NAT_D:def 3;
  hence contradiction by A6,NAT_D:7,10;

theorem
  (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1) implies n1 = n2 & m1 = m2
proof
A1: 2|^n1 <> 0 by Th106;
  assume
A2: (2|^n1)*(2*m1+1) = (2|^n2)*(2*m2+1);
  then
A3: n2 <= n1 by Lm4;
  n1 <= n2 by A2,Lm4;
  hence n1 = n2 by A3,XXREAL_0:1;
  then 2*m1+1 = 2*m2+1 by A2,A1,XCMPLX_1:5;
  hence thesis;
