theorem
     for B being Subset of GX, p be Point of GX st p in B
  holds skl(p,B) is connected
proof let B be Subset of GX, p be Point of GX;
 assume A1: p in B;
 then reconsider B' = B as non empty Subset of GX;
  A2:skl Down(p,B') is connected by CONNSP_1:41;
      skl(p,B)=skl Down(p,B) by A1,Th27;
 hence thesis by A2,Th34;
