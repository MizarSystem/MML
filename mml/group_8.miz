 proof
   let x be set;
   assume x in the carrier of gr {b}; then
A5: x in gr {b} by RLVECT_1:def 1; then
   x in G by GROUP_2:49; then

   consider m being Integer such that
A6: a = b|^m by A5,GR_CY_1:25;
   set k = m mod ord b;

     a = 1.G by A7,A8,GROUP_1:43
      .= b |^ ord b by A1,GROUP_1:def 12
      .= f.ord b by A3,A9;
   hence x in rng f by A4,A9,FUNCT_1:def 5;
   end;
   suppose k <> 0; then
   k > 0 & k < ord b by A2,NEWTON:79; then
   k >= 0+1 & k <= ord b by NAT_1:38; then
A10:k in Seg ord b by FINSEQ_1:3; then
   a = f.k by A3,A7;
   hence x in rng f by A4,A10,FUNCT_1:def 5;
