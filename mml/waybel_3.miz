theorem
      for T being non empty TopSpace st T is locally-compact
  holds InclPoset the topology of T is continuous
  proof let T be non empty TopSpace such that
A1:  T is locally-compact;
   set L = InclPoset the topology of T;
A2:  L = RelStr(#the topology of T, RelIncl the topology of T#)
 by YELLOW_1:def 1;
   thus for x being Element of L holds waybelow x is non empty directed;
   thus L is up-complete;
   let x be Element of L;    x in the topology of T by A2;
   then reconsider X = x as Subset of T;
   thus x c= sup waybelow x
     proof let a be set; assume
A3:     a in x; then a in X;
       then a in the carrier of T & X is open by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
      then consider Y being Subset of T such that
A4:     a in Int Y & Y c= X & Y is compact by A1,A3,Def9;
      reconsider iY = Int Y as Subset of T;
      reconsider y = iY as Element of L by A2,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
            y c= Y by TOPS_1:44;
       then y << x by A4,Th39;
       then y in waybelow x;
       then y c= union waybelow x by ZFMISC_1:92;
       then y c= sup waybelow x by YELLOW_1:22;
      hence thesis by A4;
     end;
   let a be set; assume a in sup waybelow x;
    then a in union waybelow x by YELLOW_1:22;
   then consider Y being set such that
A5:  a in Y & Y in waybelow x by TARSKI:def 4;
   consider y being Element of L such that
A6:  Y = y & y << x by A5;
         y <= x by A6,Th1;
