reserve a,b,d for set;

scheme
  Schemat0 {P[set]} : ex a st P[a]
provided
A1: for a holds P[a]
proof
  consider a;
  P[a] by A1;
  hence thesis;
end;

scheme
  Schemat3 {S[set,set]} : for b ex a st S[a,b]
provided
A1: ex a st for b holds S[a,b]
proof
  thus thesis by A1;
end;

scheme
  Schemat8 {P[set],Q[set]} : (for a holds P[a]) implies for a holds Q[a]
provided
A1: for a holds P[a] implies Q[a]
proof
  thus thesis by A1;
end;

scheme
  Schemat9 {P[set],Q[set]} : (for a holds P[a]) iff for a holds Q[a]
provided
A1: for a holds P[a] iff Q[a]
proof
  thus (for a holds P[a]) implies for a holds Q[a]
  proof
    assume
A2: for a holds P[a];
    now
      let a;
      P[a] iff Q[a] by A1;
      hence Q[a] by A2;

  now
    let a;
    P[a] iff Q[a] by A1;
    hence P[a] by A3;
  end;
  hence thesis;

scheme

provided
A1: for a holds P[a] implies T[]
proof
  assume
A2: for a holds P[a];
  now
    let a;
    P[a] by A2;
    hence thesis by A1;
  end;
  hence thesis;

provided
A1: (ex a st P[a]) or for b holds Q[b]
proof
  now
A2: now
      consider a;
      assume
      for b holds Q[b];
      then for b holds P[a] or Q[b];
      hence thesis;
    end;
    now

provided
A1: for b ex a st P[a] or Q[b]
proof

provided
A1: for b ex a st P[a] & Q[b]
proof
  assume
A2: (for a holds not P[a]) or ex b st not Q[b];
  per cases by A2;
  suppose
    ex b st not Q[b];
    then consider b such that
A3: not Q[b];
    now

      assume
      d = b;
      ex a st P[a] & Q[b] by A1;

proof
A2: for b ex a st P[a] & Q[b] by A1;
  (ex a st P[a]) & for b holds Q[b] from Schemat22b(A2);
  hence thesis;

provided
A1: for a,b holds S[a,b]
proof
  now
