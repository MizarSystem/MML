theorem

  proof
    defpred Z[set] means ex x being Real st x=$1 & P[x];
    consider X being set such that

    proof
      let r be set;

    then reconsider X as Subset of REAL;
    take X;
    let x be Real;
    x in X implies P[x]
    proof
      assume x in X;
      then ex y being Real st y = x & P[y] by A1;
