theorem Th12:
  for X,Y being non empty TopSpace, Y0 being non empty SubSpace of

  S, T0 being non empty SubSpace of T, f being Function of S,T st f is
being_homeomorphism for g being Function of S0,T0 st g = f|S0 & g is onto holds
  g is being_homeomorphism
proof
  let S,T be non empty TopSpace, S0 be non empty SubSpace of S, T0 be non
  empty SubSpace of T, f be Function of S,T such that

  thus dom g = [#]S0 by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  thus
A8: rng g = [#]T0 by A5,FUNCT_2:def 3;
A9: f is one-to-one by A1,TOPS_2:def 5;
  hence
A10: g is one-to-one by A6,FUNCT_1:84;
  f is continuous by A1,TOPS_2:def 5;
  then g is continuous Function of S0,T by A4;
  hence g is continuous by Th12;
