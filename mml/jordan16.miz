     f be map of S,T such that
A1: f is_homeomorphism;
 let g be map of S0,T0 such that

 thus

A5: f is one-to-one by A1,TOPS_2:def 5;

 hence
A7: g is one-to-one by A5,FUNCT_1:84;
      f is continuous by A1,TOPS_2:def 5;
  then g is continuous map of S0,T by A2,TMAP_1:68;

  holds f is_homeomorphism
proof
 let f be map of R^1, R^1;
 let a,b be Real such that
A1: a <> 0 and
A2: f = AffineMap(a,b);
A3: [#]R^1 = REAL by PRE_TOPC:12,TOPMETR:24;
 hence dom f = [#]R^1 by A2,FUNCT_2:def 1;
 thus
A4: rng f = [#]R^1 by A1,A2,A3,Th32;
 thus
A5: f is one-to-one by A1,A2,Th27;
      for x being Real holds f.x = a*x + b by A2,Def3;
 hence f is continuous by TOPMETR:28;
       f" = (f qua Function)" by A4,A5,TOPS_2:def 4
     .= AffineMap(a",-b/a) by A1,A2,Th33;
  then for x being Real holds f".x = a"*x + -b/a by Def3;
 hence f" is continuous by TOPMETR:28;
