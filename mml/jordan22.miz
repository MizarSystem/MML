theorem
  LMP C in Lower_Arc C & UMP C in Upper_Arc C or
  UMP C in Lower_Arc C & LMP C in Upper_Arc C
proof
A1: South_Arc C c= C by Th12;
A2: LMP C in South_Arc C by Th10;
A3: North_Arc C c= C by Th11;
A4: UMP C in North_Arc C by Th9;
  now
    per cases by A1,A2,A3,A4,JORDAN16:11;
    case LE LMP C, UMP C, C;
    then LMP C in Upper_Arc C & UMP C in Lower_Arc C
      or LMP C in Lower_Arc C & UMP C in Lower_Arc C
      or LMP C in Upper_Arc C & UMP C in Upper_Arc C by JORDAN6:def 10;
    hence UMP C in Lower_Arc C & LMP C in Upper_Arc C by JORDAN21:62,63;
    end;
    case LE UMP C, LMP C, C;
    then UMP C in Upper_Arc C & LMP C in Lower_Arc C
      or LMP C in Lower_Arc C & UMP C in Lower_Arc C
      or LMP C in Upper_Arc C & UMP C in Upper_Arc C by JORDAN6:def 10;
    hence LMP C in Lower_Arc C & UMP C in Upper_Arc C by JORDAN21:62,63;
