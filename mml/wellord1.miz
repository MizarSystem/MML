proof
  R is reflexive iff R is_reflexive_in field R by RELAT_2:def 9;
  hence thesis by RELAT_2:def 1;
end;

Lm2: R is transitive iff for x,y,z st [x,y] in R & [y,z] in R holds [x,z] in R
proof

  thus R is transitive implies for x,y,z st [x,y] in R & [y,z] in R holds [x,z
  ] in R

  proof
    assume

end;

Lm3: R is antisymmetric iff for x,y st [x,y] in R & [y,x] in R holds x = y
proof

  thus R is antisymmetric implies for x,y st [x,y] in R & [y,x] in R holds x =
  y

  proof

  then
  for x,y st x in field R & y in field R & [x,y] in R & [y,x] in R holds x
  = y;

  then R is_antisymmetric_in field R by RELAT_2:def 4;

  uniqueness
  proof
    let X1,X2 be set such that
