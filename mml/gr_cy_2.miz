::::::::::::: Some properties of natural and integer numbers.:::::::::::

theorem Th1:
 for n,m st 0 < m holds n mod m= n - m * (n div m)
  proof
   let n,m such that A1: m >0;
   reconsider z1=m * (n div m),z2=(n mod m) as Integer;
      n - z1 = z1 + z2 -z1 by A1,NAT_1:47;
   hence n -m * (n div m) = n mod m;
  end;

theorem Th2:
 i2 >= 0 implies i1 mod i2 >= 0
  proof
   assume A1:i2 >= 0;
   per cases by A1;
   suppose A2:i2 > 0;
      [\ i1/i2 /] <= i1/i2 by INT_1:def 4;
   then i1 div i2 <= i1/i2 by INT_1:def 7;
   then (i1 div i2)*i2 <= (i1/i2)*i2 by A2,AXIOMS:25;
   then (i1 div i2)*i2 <= i1 by A2,XCMPLX_1:88;
   then i1 - (i1 div i2)*i2 >= 0 by SQUARE_1:12;
   hence thesis by A2,INT_1:def 8;
   end;
   suppose i2 = 0;
   hence thesis by INT_1:def 8;
 end;
 end;

theorem Th3:
 i2 > 0 implies i1 mod i2 < i2
proof
 assume A1: i2 > 0;
    i1/i2 -1 < [\ i1/i2 /] by INT_1:def 4;
 then i1/i2 -1 < i1 div i2 by INT_1:def 7;
 then (i1/i2 -1)*i2 < (i1 div i2)*i2 by A1,REAL_1:70;
 then i1/i2*i2 -1*i2 < (i1 div i2)*i2;
 then i1 -i2 < (i1 div i2)*i2-0 by A1,XCMPLX_1:88;
 then i1 -(i1 div i2)*i2 < i2-0 by REAL_2:170;
 hence thesis by A1,INT_1:def 8;
end;

theorem Th4:
 i2 <> 0 implies i1 = (i1 div i2) * i2 + (i1 mod i2)
proof
 assume i2 <> 0;
 then (i1 div i2) * i2 +(i1 mod i2) =
 (i1 div i2 )*i2 + (i1 - ( i1 div i2 )*i2 ) by INT_1:def 8
 .= i1;
 hence thesis;

                    1*m + i1*n=m;
                 hence thesis;
               end;
        hence thesis by A3;

       suppose A4:n>0;
               ex i,i1 st i*m+i1*n=n
               proof
                 set i=0;
                  i*m + 1*n=n;
                 hence thesis;
