   for x being Point of X,V being Subset of REAL st
    f.x in V & V is open holds
     ex W being Subset of X st x in W & W is open & f.:W c= V
proof
   let X be non empty TopSpace,f be RealMap of X;
   hereby assume A1: f is continuous;
    now let x be Point of X,V being Subset of REAL;
     set r = f.x;
     assume r in V & V is open; then

     r in S by RCOMP_1:8;
     hence x in W by FUNCT_2:46;
     thus W is open by PSCOMP_1:54,A1;
     f.:(f"S) c= S by FUNCT_1:145;
     hence f.:W c= V by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
    end;
    hence for x being Point of X,V being Subset of REAL st
      f.x in V & V is open holds
       ex W being Subset of X st x in W & W is open & f.:W c= V;

   now let Y be Subset of REAL;
    assume Y is closed; then
    Y`` is closed; then

    for x being Point of X st x in (f"Y)` ex W being Subset of X st
     W is a_neighborhood of x & W c= (f"Y)`
    proof
     let x be Point of X;
     assume x in (f"Y)`; then
     x in f"Y` by FUNCT_2:177; then
     f.x in Y` by FUNCT_2:46; then

     consider W being Subset of X such that
A6:   x in W & W is open & f.:W c= V by A3,A5;
     take W;
     thus W is a_neighborhood of x by A6,CONNSP_2:5;

A7:  f"(f.:W) c= f"Y` by RELAT_1:178;
     W c= f"(f.:W) by FUNCT_2:50; then
     W c= f"Y` by A7,XBOOLE_1:1;
     hence W c= (f"Y)` by FUNCT_2:177;
    end; then
    (f"Y)` is open by CONNSP_2:9; then
    (f"Y)`` is closed by TOPS_1:30;
    hence f"Y is closed;

   end;
A3:now let a,b be real number;
    a is Real & b is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;

   end;
   now let a,b be real number;

for W be Normed_AlgebraStr, V be Algebra st
 the AlgebraStr of W = V holds W is Algebra
proof
   let W be Normed_AlgebraStr,V be Algebra such that
A1:the AlgebraStr of W = V;
   reconsider W as non empty AlgebraStr by A1;
L1:for x,y being VECTOR of W holds x + y = y + x
   proof
    let x,y be VECTOR of W;
    reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y as VECTOR of V by A1;
    x + y = x1+y1 by A1; then
    x + y =y1 + x1;
    hence x + y = y + x by A1;
   end;
L2:for x,y,z being VECTOR of W holds (x + y) + z = x + (y + z)
   proof
    let x,y,z be VECTOR of W;
    reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y, z1 = z as VECTOR of V by A1;
    (x + y) + z = (x1 + y1) + z1 by A1; then
    (x + y) + z = x1 + (y1 + z1) by RLVECT_1:def 6;
    hence (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) by A1;
   end;
L3:for x being VECTOR of W holds x + 0.W = x
   proof
    let x be VECTOR of W;
    reconsider y = x, z = 0.W as VECTOR of V by A1;
    x + 0.W = y + 0.V by A1;
    hence x + 0.W = x by RLVECT_1:10;
   end;
L4:for x being Element of W holds x is right_complementable
   proof
    let x be Element of W;
    reconsider x1 = x as Element of V by A1;
    consider v be Element of V such that
A2:  x1 + v = 0.V by ALGSTR_0:def 11;

    x + y = 0.W by A2,A1;

L5:for v,w being Element of W holds v * w = w * v
   proof
    let v,w be Element of W;
    reconsider v1 = v, w1 = w as Element of V by A1;
    v * w = v1*w1 by A1; then
    v * w = w1*v1;
    hence v * w =w*v by A1;
   end;
L6:for a,b,x being Element of W holds (a * b) * x = a * (b * x)
   proof
    let a,b,x be Element of W;
    reconsider y = x, a1 = a, b1 = b as Element of V by A1;
    (a * b) * x = (a1 * b1) * y by A1; then
    (a * b) * x = a1 * (b1 * y) by GROUP_1:def 4;
    hence (a * b) * x = a * (b * x) by A1;
   end;
L7:W is right_unital
   proof
    let x be Element of W;
    reconsider x1 = x as Element of V by A1;
    x*1.W = x1*1.V by A1;
    hence x*1.W = x by VECTSP_1:def 13;
   end;
L8:W is right-distributive
   proof
    let x,y,z being Element of W;
    reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y, z1 = z as Element of V by A1;
    x*(y+z) = x1*(y1+z1) by A1; then
    x*(y+z) = x1*y1 + x1*z1 by VECTSP_1:def 11;
    hence x*(y+z) = x*y + x*z by A1;
   end;
   W is Algebra-like
   proof
    let x,y,z being Element of W;
    let a,b be Real;
    reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y, z1 = z as Element of V by A1;
    a*(x*y) = a*(x1*y1) by A1; then
    a*(x*y) = (a*x1)*y1 by FUNCSDOM:def 20;
    hence a*(x*y) = (a*x)*y by A1;
    a*(x+y) = a*(x1+y1) by A1; then
    a*(x+y) = a*x1 + a*y1 by FUNCSDOM:def 20;
    hence a*(x+y) = a*x + a*y by A1;
    (a+b)*x = (a+b)*x1 by A1; then
    (a+b)*x = a*x1 + b*x1 by FUNCSDOM:def 20;
    hence (a+b)*x =a*x + b*x by A1;
    (a*b)*x = (a*b)*x1 by A1; then
