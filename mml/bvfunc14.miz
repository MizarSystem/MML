reserve Y for non empty set,
  G for Subset of PARTITIONS(Y),
  A,B,C,D,E,F for a_partition of Y;

theorem Th1:
  for z being Element of Y, PA,PB being a_partition of Y holds
  EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB) = EqClass(z,PA) /\ EqClass(z,PB)
proof
  let z be Element of Y, PA,PB be a_partition of Y;
A1: EqClass(z,PA) /\ EqClass(z,PB) c= EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB)
  proof
    set Z=EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB);
    let x be set;
    assume
A2: x in EqClass(z,PA) /\ EqClass(z,PB);
    then reconsider x as Element of Y;
A3: x in EqClass(x,PA) by EQREL_1:def 8;
    x in EqClass(z,PA) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then
A4: EqClass(x,PA) meets EqClass(z,PA) by A3,XBOOLE_0:3;
A5: x in EqClass(x,PB) by EQREL_1:def 8;
    PA '/\' PB = INTERSECTION(PA,PB) \ {{}} by PARTIT1:def 4;
    then Z in INTERSECTION(PA,PB) by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
    then consider X,Y being set such that
A6: X in PA and
A7: Y in PB and
A8: Z = X /\ Y by SETFAM_1:def 5;
A9: z in X /\ Y by A8,EQREL_1:def 8;
    then z in EqClass(z,PB) & z in Y by EQREL_1:def 8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then Y meets EqClass(z,PB) by XBOOLE_0:3;
    then
A10: Y=EqClass(z,PB) by A7,EQREL_1:def 6;
    x in EqClass(z,PB) by A2,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then
A11: EqClass(x,PB) meets EqClass(z,PB) by A5,XBOOLE_0:3;
    z in EqClass(z,PA) & z in X by A9,EQREL_1:def 8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then X meets EqClass(z,PA) by XBOOLE_0:3;
    then X=EqClass(z,PA) by A6,EQREL_1:def 6;
    then
A12: X=EqClass(x,PA) by A4,EQREL_1:50;
    x in EqClass(x,PA) /\ EqClass(x,PB) by A3,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    hence thesis by A11,A8,A10,A12,EQREL_1:50;
  end;
  EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB) c= EqClass(z,PA) /\ EqClass(z,PB)
  proof
    let x be set;
A13: EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB) c= EqClass(z,PA) & EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB) c=
    EqClass(z, PB) by BVFUNC11:3;
    assume x in EqClass(z,PA '/\' PB);
    hence thesis by A13,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

    let d be set;
    assume d in G;
    then d=A or d=B or d=C or d=D or d=E or d=F or d=J or d=M or d=N by A2,
