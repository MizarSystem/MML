:: Topological spaces

theorem Th1:
 for T being TopStruct,
     F being Subset-Family of T holds
   F is_a_cover_of T iff the carrier of T c= union F
proof
  let T be TopStruct,
      F be Subset-Family of T;
  thus F is_a_cover_of T implies the carrier of T c= union F
  proof
    assume F is_a_cover_of T;
    then [#]T = union F by PRE_TOPC:def 8;
    hence the carrier of T c= union F;
  end;
  assume
     the carrier of T c= union F;
  then the carrier of T = union F by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
  then [#] T = union F;
  hence F is_a_cover_of T by PRE_TOPC:def 8;
end;

reserve A for non empty SubSpace of T;

theorem Th2: for p being Point of A holds p is Point of T
 proof
      [#] A c= [#] T by PRE_TOPC:def 9;
  then the carrier of A c= [#] T;
  then the carrier of A c= the carrier of T;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:def 3;
 end;

theorem   T is_T2 implies A is_T2
 proof
  assume A1: T is_T2;
       for p,q being Point of A st not p = q
    ex W,V being Subset of A st W is open & V is open &
     p in W & q in V & W misses V
    proof
     let p,q be Point of A such that A2: not p = q;
     reconsider p' = p, q' = q as Point of T by Th2;
     consider W,V  being Subset of T such that
     A3: W is open & V is open &
      p' in W & q' in V & W misses V by A1,A2,COMPTS_1:def 4;
A4:   W /\ V = {} by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
         W /\ [#] A c= [#] A & V /\ [#] A c= [#] A by XBOOLE_1:17;
     then reconsider W' = W /\ [#] A, V' = V /\ [#] A as Subset of A;
     take W', V';
         W in the topology of T & V in the topology of T by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 5;
     then W' in the topology of A & V' in the topology of A by PRE_TOPC:def 9;
     hence W' is open & V' is open by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
     thus p in W' & q in V' by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
         W' /\ V' = W /\ (V /\ [#] A) /\ [#] A by XBOOLE_1:16
            .= {} /\ [#] A by A4,XBOOLE_1:16
            .= {};
     hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 7;

theorem Th4: for T being TopSpace, A,B being SubSpace of T st
     the carrier of A c= the carrier of B holds A is SubSpace of B
 proof
  let T be TopSpace, A,B be SubSpace of T;
   assume the carrier of A c= the carrier of B;
   then the carrier of A c= [#] B;
 then A1: [#] A c= [#] B;
      for P being Subset of A holds P in the topology of A iff
   ex Q being Subset of B st Q in
 the topology of B & P = Q /\ [#] A
  proof
   let P be Subset of A;
   thus P in the topology of A implies ex Q being Subset of B st
                            Q in the topology of B & P = Q /\ [#] A
    proof
     assume P in the topology of A;
     then consider Q' being Subset of T such that
   A2: Q' in the topology of T & P = Q' /\ [#] A by PRE_TOPC:def 9;
         Q' /\ [#] B c= [#] B by XBOOLE_1:17;
     then reconsider Q = Q' /\ [#]

         P = Q' /\ ([#] B /\ [#] A) by A1,A2,XBOOLE_1:28 .= Q /\ [#] A by
XBOOLE_1:16;
     hence ex Q being Subset of B
       st Q in the topology of B & P = Q /\ [#] A
       by A3;
    end;
   given Q being Subset of B such that
 A4: Q in the topology of B & P = Q /\ [#] A;
   consider P' being Subset of T such that
 A5: P' in the topology of T & Q = P' /\ [#] B by A4,PRE_TOPC:def 9;
       P = P' /\ ([#] B /\ [#] A) by A4,A5,XBOOLE_1:16 .= P' /\ [#] A by A1,
XBOOLE_1:28;
   hence P in the topology of A by A5,PRE_TOPC:def 9;
  end;
  hence A is SubSpace of B by A1,PRE_TOPC:def 9;
 end;

reserve P,Q for Subset of T, p for Point of T;

theorem   T|P is SubSpace of T|(P \/ Q) & T|Q is SubSpace of T|(P \/ Q)
 proof
   thus T|P is SubSpace of T|(P \/ Q)
    proof
         [#](T|P) = P by PRE_TOPC:def 10;
     then A1: the carrier of T|P = P;
         [#](T|(P \/ Q)) = P \/ Q
     by PRE_TOPC:def 10;
     then the carrier of T|(P \/ Q) = P \/ Q &
     P c= P \/ Q
      by XBOOLE_1:7;
     hence T|P is SubSpace of T|(P \/ Q) by A1,Th4;
    end;
       [#](T|Q) = Q by PRE_TOPC:def 10;
   then A2: the carrier of T|Q = Q;
       [#](T|(P \/ Q)) = P \/ Q by PRE_TOPC:def 10;
   then the carrier of T|(P \/ Q) = P \/ Q & Q c= P \/ Q
    by XBOOLE_1:7;

Lm3: for r be real number holds r >= 0 & a + r <= b implies a <= b
 proof
  let r be real number;
  assume A1: r >= 0 & a + r <= b;
  then a + r - r <= b - r by XREAL_1:11;
  then a <= b - r & b - r <= b by A1,REAL_2:173;

theorem
     for f being Function of R^1,R^1 st
  ex a,b being Real st for x being Real holds f.x = a*x + b holds
   f is continuous
 proof

      for W being Point of R^1, G being a_neighborhood of f.W
