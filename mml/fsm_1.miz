theorem
  for M1, M2 being connected reduced (finite non empty Mealy-FSM over
  IAlph, OAlph) holds M1, M2-are_isomorphic iff M1, M2-are_equivalent
proof
  let M1, M2 be connected reduced (finite non empty Mealy-FSM over IAlph,
  OAlph);
  thus M1, M2-are_isomorphic implies M1, M2-are_equivalent by Th82;
A1: M2, the_reduction_of M2-are_isomorphic by Th64;
  assume M1, M2-are_equivalent;
  then

  then M1, the_reduction_of M2-are_isomorphic by A2,Th59;
  hence thesis by A1,Th59;
