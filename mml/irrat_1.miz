    .= x by POWER:30;
A7: eseq^\(n+1) is summable by Th24,SERIES_1:15;
  n+1>0+1 by A1,XREAL_1:8;
  then
A8: x<1 by A2,XREAL_1:214;
A9: now
    let k;
    thus seq.(k+1) = x ^ (k+1+1) by A3
      .= x ^ 1*(x^(k+1)) by A2,POWER:32
      .= x*(x^(k+1)) by POWER:30
      .= x*seq.k by A3;
  end;
  abs x=x by A2,ABSVALUE:def 1;
  then seq is summable by A8,A9,SERIES_1:29;
  then
A10: Sum(n!(#)(eseq^\(n+1)))<=Sum(seq) by A4,SERIES_1:24;
  abs x<1 by A2,A8,ABSVALUE:def 1;
  then Sum(seq)=x/(1-x) by A6,A9,SERIES_1:29;
  hence thesis by A7,A10,SERIES_1:13;

theorem Th41:
  for n be real number st n>=2 & x=1/(n+1) holds x/(1-x)<1
proof
  let n be real number;
  assume that
A1: n>=2 and
A2: x=1/(n+1);
  n+1 > n by XREAL_1:31;
  then 2<n+1 by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
  then 2/(n+1)<1 by XREAL_1:191;
  then x+x<1 by A2;
  then x<1-x by XREAL_1:22;
  hence thesis by A1,A2,XREAL_1:191;
end;

::$N Irrationality of e
theorem
  number_e is irrational
proof
  assume number_e is rational;
  then consider n such that
A1: n>=2 and
A2: n!*number_e is integer by Th32;
  reconsider ne = n!*number_e as Integer by A2;
  set x = 1/(n+1);
  reconsider ne1 = n!*Partial_Sums(eseq).n as Integer by Th38;
  n!*number_e = n!*((Partial_Sums(eseq).n)+Sum(eseq^\(n+1))) by Th24,
SERIES_1:18
    .= n!*(Partial_Sums(eseq).n)+n!*Sum(eseq^\(n+1));
  then
A3: n!*Sum(eseq^\(n+1))=ne-ne1;
  x/(1-x)<1 & n!*Sum(eseq^\(n+1))<=x/(1-x) by A1,Th40,Th41;
  then n!*Sum(eseq^\(n+1))<0+1 by XXREAL_0:2;
  hence contradiction by A3,Th36,INT_1:20;
end;
