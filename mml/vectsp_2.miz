proof
A1: for x,y,z being Scalar of R for x9,y9,z9 be Element of RIGHTMODULE(R) st
  x = x9 & y = y9 & z = z9 holds x + y = x9+ y9;
  thus RIGHTMODULE(R) is Abelian
  proof
    let x,y be Element of RIGHTMODULE(R);
    reconsider x9= x, y9= y as Scalar of R;
    thus x+y = y9+ x9 by A1

  thus RIGHTMODULE(R) is add-associative
  proof
    let x,y,z be Element of RIGHTMODULE(R);
    reconsider x9= x, y9= y, z9= z as Scalar of R;
    thus (x+y)+z = (x9+ y9) + z9 .= x9+ (y9+ z9) by RLVECT_1:def 6

  end;
  thus RIGHTMODULE(R) is right_zeroed
  proof
    let x be Element of RIGHTMODULE(R);
