reserve x,r,a,b for Real;

theorem Th1:
 for x,y,z being real number holds
  x <= y & y <= z implies [. x,y .] /\ [. y,z .] = {y}
 proof
  let x,y,z be real number;
  assume x <= y & y <= z;
   then y in [. x,y .] & y in [. y,z .] by RCOMP_1:15;
   then y in [. x,y .] /\ [. y,z .] by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
  then A1: {y} c= [. x,y .] /\ [. y,z .] by ZFMISC_1:37;
      [. x,y .] /\ [. y,z .] c= {y}
   proof
    let a be set; assume a in [. x,y .] /\ [. y,z .];
    then a in [. x,y .] & a in [. y,z .] by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    then A2: a in {r: x<=r & r<=y} & a in {b: y<=b & b<=z} by RCOMP_1:def 1;
    then A3: ex r st r=a & x <= r & r <= y;
        ex b st b=a & y <= b & b <= z by A2;
    then a = y by A3,AXIOMS:21;
    hence a in {y} by TARSKI:def 1;
   end;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

theorem   f is one-to-one & g is one-to-one &
 (for x1,x2 st x1 in dom g & x2 in dom f \ dom g holds g.x1 <> f.x2) implies
  f+*g is one-to-one
proof

         then f.x11 = f.x22 by A6,A9,A13,FUNCT_4:def 1;
        hence x11 = x22 by A1,A12,A14,FUNCT_1:def 8;
        end;
        case A15: x22 in dom g;
         then g.x22 <> f.x11 by A3,A11;
        hence contradiction by A6,A9,A13,A15,FUNCT_4:def 1;
       end;
       end;
       hence x11 = x22;
      end;

         then (f+*g).x22 = g.x22 by A9,FUNCT_4:def 1;
         then g.x11 = g.x22 by A6,A7,A16,FUNCT_4:def 1;

end;

theorem   f.:(dom f /\ dom g) c= rng g implies rng f \/ rng g = rng(f+*g)
proof
 assume f.:(dom f /\ dom g) c= rng g;
  then A1: rng f \ rng g c= rng(f+*g) by Lm1;
      rng g c= rng(f +* g) by FUNCT_4:19;
  then (rng f \ rng g) \/ rng g c= rng(f +* g) by A1,XBOOLE_1:8;
