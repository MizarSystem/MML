:: '+' operation only

theorem Th1: :: AXIOMS'13
  a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
proof
   consider x1,x2,y1,y2 being Element of REAL such that
A1: a = [*x1,x2*] and
A2: b = [*y1,y2*] and
A3: a+b = [*+(x1,y1),+(x2,y2)*] by XCMPLX_0:def 4;
   consider y3,y4,z1,z2 being Element of REAL such that
A4: b = [*y3,y4*] and

A7: y1 = y3 & y2 = y4 by A2,A4,ARYTM_0:12;
   consider x3,x4,yz1,yz2 being Element of REAL such that
A8: a = [*x3,x4*] and

A11: x1 = x3 & x2 = x4 by A1,A8,ARYTM_0:12;
   consider xy1,xy2,z3,z4 being Element of REAL such that

  hence thesis by A10,A11,A14,A15,A16,A17,ARYTM_0:25;

theorem Th2: :: REAL_1'10
  a + c = b + c implies a = b
proof
  assume a + c = b + c;
  then a + (c + -c) = b + c + -c by Th1;
  then a + 0 = b + c + -c by XCMPLX_0:def 6;
  then a = b + (c + -c) by Th1;

  a-a=0
proof
  thus a-a = a+ -a by XCMPLX_0:def 8
          .= 0 by XCMPLX_0:def 6;
end;

Lm2: a + b - c = a - c + b
proof
  thus a + b - c = a + b + - c by XCMPLX_0:def 8
                .= a + - c + b by Th1
                .= a - c + b by XCMPLX_0:def 8;
end;

theorem  :: INT_1'24
    a = a + b implies b = 0
proof
  assume a = a + b;
  then 0 = a + b - a by Lm1
   .= a - a + b by Lm2;
  then 0 = 0 + b by Lm1;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem
 a+b+c-b=a+c
proof a+b+c-b=a+b-b+c by Lm2;
 hence a+b+c-b=a+c by Lm8;
end;

theorem
 a-b+c+b=a+c
proof
    a-b+c+b=a+c-b+b by Lm2;
 hence a-b+c+b=a+c by Lm7;

theorem
  a+b-c-b=a-c
proof
 thus a+b-c-b=b+(a-c)-b by Lm2 .=a-c by Lm8;

theorem
  a-b-c+b=a-c
proof
 thus a-b-c+b=a-b-(c-b) by Lm5 .=a-c by Th22;

proof
 thus a-a-b=a-a+-b by XCMPLX_0:def 8 .=-b by Th25;

theorem
 -a+a-b=-b
proof
 thus -a+a-b=-a+a+-b by XCMPLX_0:def 8 .=-b by Th138;

theorem
 a-b-a=-b
proof
 thus a-b-a=a+-b-a by XCMPLX_0:def 8 .=-b by Lm8;

theorem
  -a-b+a=-b
