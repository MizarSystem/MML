theorem Th3:
  meet X c= union X
proof
A1:  now assume
A2:    X <> {};
         now let x such that

         consider y being Element of X;
           x in y by A2,A3,Def1;
        hence x in union X by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
       end;
      hence thesis by TARSKI:def 3;
     end;
       now assume X = {};
       then meet X = {} by Def1;
      hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:2;
     end;
   hence meet X c= union X by A1;
end;

theorem Th4:
  Z in X implies meet X c= Z
proof assume
A1:  Z in X;
       now thus meet X c= Z
      proof
       let x;
        assume x in meet X;
       hence x in Z by A1,Def1;

proof assume

theorem
   X <> {} & (for Z1 st Z1 in X holds Z c= Z1) implies Z c= meet X
proof assume
A1:  X <> {} & for Z1 st Z1 in X holds Z c= Z1;

         for Y st Y in X holds x in Y
       proof

  X <> {} & X c= Y implies meet Y c= meet X
proof assume
A1:  X <> {} & X c= Y;

theorem
    X in Y & X c= Z implies meet Y c= Z
proof assume
A1:  X in Y & X c= Z;
   then meet Y c= X by Th4;

end;

theorem
    X in Y & X misses Z implies meet Y misses Z
proof assume

theorem
    X <> {} & Y <> {} implies meet (X \/ Y) = meet X /\ meet Y
proof assume

then A2:  X \/ Y <> {} by XBOOLE_1:15;
       X c= X \/ Y & Y c= X \/ Y by XBOOLE_1:7;

       meet X /\ meet Y c= meet (X \/ Y)
     proof
      let x;assume x in meet X /\ meet Y;
then A4:    x in meet X & x in meet Y by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
         now
        let Z; assume Z in X \/ Y;
         then Z in X or Z in Y by XBOOLE_0:def 2;

    proof
     let y;assume
     y in x;

proof
A1:  X in {X,Y} & Y in {X,Y} by TARSKI:def 2;
       x in meet {X,Y} iff x in X & x in Y
     proof
      thus x in meet {X,Y} implies x in X & x in Y by A1,Def1;
      assume x in X & x in Y;
      then for Z holds
     Z in {X,Y} implies x in Z by TARSKI:def 2;
