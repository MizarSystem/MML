begin :: Some theorems on real and natural numbers.

theorem Th1:
  for r,s being real number holds 0<=r & s*s<r*r implies s<r
proof
  let r,s be real number;
  assume that
A1: 0<=r and
A2: s*s<r*r;
  assume
  s>=r;
  then r*s<=s*s & r*r<=s*r by A1,XREAL_1:66;
  hence contradiction by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for r,s being real number holds 1<r & r*r <= s implies r<s
proof
  let r,s be real number;
  assume that
A1: 1<r and
A2: r*r <= s;
  r<r*r by A1,XREAL_1:157;
  hence thesis by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for a,n being Nat st a>1 holds a|^n > n
proof
  defpred P[Nat] means for a being Nat st a>1 holds a|^$1 > $1;
A1: for n being Nat holds P[n] implies P[n+1]
  proof
    let n be Nat;
    assume
A2: P[n];
    now
      let a be Nat;
      assume
A3:   a>1;
      then a>=1+1 by NAT_1:13;

      per cases;
      suppose
        n=0;
        hence a|^(n+1)>n+1 by A3,NEWTON:10;

        then n>=0+1 by NAT_1:13;
        then n+n>=n+1 by XREAL_1:8;
        then
A5:     a*n>=n+1 by A4,XXREAL_0:2;
        (a|^n)*a>n*a by A2,A3,XREAL_1:70;
        then a|^(n+1)>n*a by NEWTON:11;
        hence a|^(n+1)>n+1 by A5,XXREAL_0:2;
      end;
    end;

  end;
A6: P[0];
  for n being Nat holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 2(A6,A1);
