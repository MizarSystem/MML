begin :: Preliminaries

reserve x,X for set,
        r,r1,r2,s for real number,
        i,j,k,m,n for Nat;

theorem Th1:
  for K be Field,M be Matrix of n,K
    for P be Permutation of Seg n holds
      Det((M*P)@*P)@ = Det M &
      for i,j st [i,j] in Indices M holds ((M*P)@*P)@*(i,j) = M*(P.i,P.j)
proof
  let K be Field,M be Matrix of n,K;
  let P be Permutation of Seg n;
  reconsider p=P as Element of Permutations(n) by MATRIX_2:def 9;
  A1: --Det M=Det M by RLVECT_1:17;
  A2: p is even & -(Det M,p)=Det M or p is odd & -(Det M,p)=-Det M
    by MATRIX_2:def 13;
  thus Det((M*P)@*P)@=Det((M*P)@*P) by MATRIXR2:43
                    .=-(Det(M*P)@,p) by MATRIX11:46
                    .=-(Det(M*P),p) by MATRIXR2:43
                    .=-(-(Det M,p),p) by MATRIX11:46
                    .=Det M by A1,A2,MATRIX_2:def 13;
  let i,j;
  assume A3: [i,j] in Indices M;
  Indices M=Indices(((M*P)@*P)@) by MATRIX_1:26;
  then A4: [j,i] in Indices((M*P)@*P) by A3,MATRIX_1:def 6;
  then A5: ((M*P)@*P)@*(i,j)=((M*P)@*P)*(j,i) by MATRIX_1:def 6;
  Indices M=Indices((M*P)@*P) & Indices M=Indices((M*P)@) by MATRIX_1:26;
  then A6: ex k st k=P.j & [k,i] in Indices(M*P)@ &
    ((M*P)@*P)*(j,i)=((M*P)@)*(k,i) by A4,MATRIX11:37;
  then A7: [i,P.j] in Indices(M*P) by MATRIX_1:def 6;
  Indices(M*P)=Indices M by MATRIX_1:26;
  then (M*P)*(i,P.j)=M*(P.i,P.j) by A7,MATRIX11:def 4;
  hence ((M*P)@*P)@*(i,j)=M*(P.i,P.j) by A5,A6,A7,MATRIX_1:def 6;

theorem Th2:
  for K be Field for M be diagonal Matrix of n,K holds M@ = M
proof
  let K be Field;
  let M be diagonal Matrix of n,K;
  for i,j st[i,j] in Indices M holds M*(i,j)=M@*(i,j)
  proof
    let i,j;
    assume A1: [i,j] in Indices M;
    then A2: [j,i] in Indices M by MATRIX_1:28;
    then A3: M@*(i,j)=M*(j,i) by MATRIX_1:def 6;
    per cases;
    suppose i=j;
      hence thesis by A1,MATRIX_1:def 6;
    end;
    suppose A4: i<>j;
      then M*(i,j)=0.K by A1,MATRIX_1:def 14;
      hence thesis by A2,A3,A4,MATRIX_1:def 14;

end;

theorem Th3:
  for f be real-valued FinSequence
    for i st i in dom f holds Sum sqr(f+*(i,r)) = (Sum sqr f)-(f.i)^2+r^2
proof

  let i such that
  A1: i in dom f;
  reconsider fi=f.i as Element of REAL;
  set F=@@f;
  set G=F| (i-' 1),H=F/^i;

  then A3: Sum sqr F=Sum(sqr G^sqr<*fi*>)+Sum sqr H by RVSUM_1:75
   .=Sum sqr G+fi^2+Sum sqr H by A2,RVSUM_1:74;
  reconsider R=r as Element of REAL by XREAL_0:def 1;
  A4: sqr<*R*>=<*R^2*> by RVSUM_1:55;
  F+*(i,R)=G^<*R*>^H by A1,FUNCT_7:98;
  then sqr(F+*(i,R))=sqr(G^<*R*>)^sqr H by RVSUM_1:144
   .=sqr G^sqr<*R*>^sqr H by RVSUM_1:144;
