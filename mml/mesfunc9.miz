  seq = +infty ) & ( seq is convergent_to_-infty implies lim seq = -infty )
proof
A1: now
    assume

    then
A3: not seq is convergent_to_+infty by MESFUNC5:56;
A4: not seq is convergent_to_-infty by A2,MESFUNC5:57;
    seq is convergent by A2,MESFUNC5:def 11;

    holds |.seq.m - lim seq.| < p and
    seq is convergent_to_finite_number by A3,A4,MESFUNC5:def 12;

theorem Th8:
  seq is nonnegative implies not seq is convergent_to_-infty
proof
  assume

    reconsider k as Element of NAT by A8;
  end;
  then
A10: rng seq c= Y by TARSKI:def 3;
  for n be Element of NAT holds sup INFSEQ >= INFSEQ.n
  proof
    let n be Element of NAT;
    NAT = dom INFSEQ by FUNCT_2:def 1;
    then INFSEQ.n in rng INFSEQ by FUNCT_1:def 5;
    hence thesis by XXREAL_2:4;

    dom seq = NAT by FUNCT_2:def 1;
    hence x in rng seq by A12,FUNCT_1:12;
  end;
  then Y c= rng seq by TARSKI:def 3;
  then Y = rng seq by A10,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
  then (inferior_realsequence seq).0 >= p by A5,A7,XXREAL_2:def 4;
  then lim_inf seq >= p by A11,XXREAL_0:2;

theorem Th11:
  seq1 is convergent & seq2 is convergent & seq1 is nonnegative &
