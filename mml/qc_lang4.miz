 existence
   proof
     consider d being Element of D;
     take root-tree d;
     thus root-tree d is finite;
   end;
end;

reserve T for DecoratedTree,
        p for FinSequence of NAT;

theorem Th8:
  T.p = (T|p).{}
proof
  <*>NAT in (dom T)|p by TREES_1:47;
  then (T|p).<*>NAT = T.(p^<*>NAT) by TREES_2:def 11
              .= T.p by FINSEQ_1:47;
  hence T.p = (T|p).{};
end;

reserve T for finite-branching DecoratedTree,
        t for Element of dom T,
        x for FinSequence,

theorem Th9:
  succ(T,t) = T*(t succ)
proof
  consider q being Element of dom T such that
A1:  q = t & succ(T,t) = T*(q succ) by TREES_9:def 6;
  thus thesis by A1;
end;

theorem Th10:
  dom (T*(t succ)) = dom (t succ)
proof
    rng (t succ) c= dom T by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
  hence thesis by RELAT_1:46;
end;

theorem Th11:
  dom succ(T,t) = dom (t succ)
proof thus

end;

theorem Th12:
  t^<*n*> in dom T iff n+1 in dom (t succ)
proof
    now assume A1: t^<*n*> in dom T;
      succ t = { t^<*k*>: t^<*k*> in dom T } by TREES_2:def 5;
    then t^<*n*> in succ t by A1;

    then 1 <= n+1 & n+1 <= len (t succ) by A2,NAT_1:38;
    then n+1 in Seg len (t succ) by FINSEQ_1:3;
    hence n+1 in dom (t succ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  end;
  hence t^<*n*> in dom T implies n+1 in dom (t succ);
  assume n+1 in dom (t succ);
  then n+1 in Seg len (t succ) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;

proof
  let T, x, n; assume A1: x^<*n*> in dom T;
    x is_a_prefix_of x^<*n*> by TREES_1:8;
  then x in dom T by A1,TREES_1:45;

                 .= T.(x^<*n*>) by A2,A5,TREES_9:def 5;
  hence T.(x^<*n*>) = succ(T,x).(n+1);
end;

reserve x, x' for Element of dom T,
        y' for set;

theorem Th14:
  x' in succ x implies T.x' in rng succ(T,x)
proof assume A1: x' in succ x;
    succ x = { x^<*n*>: x^<*n*> in dom T } by TREES_2:def 5;
  then consider n such that A2: x' = x^<*n*> & x^<*n*> in dom T by A1;
    dom (succ(T,x)) = dom (T*(x succ)) by Th9
                 .= dom (x succ) by Th10;

    T.x' = (succ(T,x)).(n+1) by A2,Th13;
  hence T.x' in rng succ(T,x) by A3,FUNCT_1:def 5;
end;

theorem Th15:
  y' in rng succ(T,x) implies ex x' st y' = T.x' & x' in succ x
proof assume y' in rng succ(T,x);
  then consider n' being set such that
A1:  n' in dom succ(T,x) & y' = (succ(T,x)).n' by FUNCT_1:def 5;
  consider k such that A2: dom succ(T,x) = Seg k by FINSEQ_1:def 2;
    Seg k = { m : 1 <= m & m <= k } by FINSEQ_1:def 1;
  then consider m' being Nat such that A3: n' = m' & 1 <= m' & m' <= k by A1,A2
;
    m' <> 0 by A3;
  then consider n such that A4: n+1 = m' by NAT_1:22;
    n+1 in dom (x succ) by A1,A3,A4,Th11;
then x^<*n*> in dom T by Th12;
  then consider x' such that A5: x' = x^<*n*>;
    succ x = { x^<*m*>: x^<*m*> in dom T } by TREES_2:def 5;
then A6:x' in succ x by A5;
    y' = T.x' by A1,A3,A4,A5,Th13;

    G2 is_subformula_of G1 implies for t1 ex t2 st t1 is_a_prefix_of t2
proof assume A1: G2 is_subformula_of G1;
    now let t1;
    consider H being Element of QC-WFF such that A2: H = G2;
    reconsider H as Subformula of G1 by A1,A2,Def4;
    consider s being Entry_Point_in_Subformula_Tree of H;
      (tree_of_subformulae(G1)).s = H by Def5;
  then s in G1-entry_points_in_subformula_tree_of G2 by A2,Def3;
    then t1^s is Entry_Point_in_Subformula_Tree of G2 by Th69;
    then consider t2 such that A3: t2 = t1^s;
    take t2;
    thus t1 is_a_prefix_of t2 by A3,TREES_1:8;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;
