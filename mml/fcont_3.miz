        take N1;
        fp < fm by A16,A18,A20,A32,RFUNCT_2:44;
        then [.fm,fp.] = {} by XXREAL_1:29;
        then
A34:    [.fm,fp.] \/ [.fp,fm.] = [.fp,fm.];
        thus N1 c= rng f
        proof
          let x;
A35:      ].fp,fm.[ c= [.fp,fm.] by XXREAL_1:25;
          assume x in N1;
          then consider r2 such that
A36:      r2 = x and
A37:      f.x0 - R < r2 and
A38:      r2 < f.x0 + R by A5;
          R <= fm - f.x0 by XXREAL_0:17;
          then f.x0 + R <= f.x0 + (fm - f.x0) by XREAL_1:9;
          then
A39:      r2 < fm by A38,XXREAL_0:2;
          R <= f.x0 - fp by XXREAL_0:17;
          then f.x0 - (f.x0 - fp) <= f.x0 - R by XREAL_1:15;
          then fp < r2 by A37,XXREAL_0:2;
          then r2 in ].fp,fm.[ by A39;
          then consider s such that
A40:      s in [.x0 - r/2, x0 + r/2.] and
A41:      x = f.s by A1,A14,A16,A34,A36,A35,FCONT_2:16,XBOOLE_1:1;
          s in N by A8,A21,A40;
          hence thesis by A13,A41,FUNCT_1:def 5;
        end;
      end;
    end;
    hence ex N be Neighbourhood of r1 st N c= rng f;
  end;
  hence thesis by RCOMP_1:41;
