existence
proof
 consider x being Point of M;
     (the carrier of M) --> x is Function of the carrier of M, the carrier of M
 proof
A1: dom ((the carrier of M) --> x) = the carrier of M by FUNCOP_1:19;
   rng ((the carrier of M) --> x) c= {x} by FUNCOP_1:19;
 then rng ((the carrier of M) --> x) c= the carrier of M by XBOOLE_1:1;
  hence thesis by A1,FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:11;
 end;
 then reconsider f = (the carrier of M) --> x as Function of the carrier of M,
   the carrier of M;
 take f, 1/2;
 thus 0<1/2 & 1/2<1;
 let z,y be Point of M;
     f.z=x & f.y=x by FUNCOP_1:13;
 then A2: dist(f.z,f.y) = 0 by METRIC_1:1;
     dist(z,y)>=0 by METRIC_1:5;
 hence dist(f.z,f.y)<=(1/2)*dist(z,y) by A2,REAL_2:121;
end;
end;

theorem
    for f being contraction of M st TopSpaceMetr(M) is compact
ex c being Point of M st f.c =c &            :: exists a fix point
for x being Point of M st f.x=x holds x=c    :: exactly 1 fix point
proof
  let f be contraction of M;
  consider L being Real such that
  A1: 0<L & L<1 and
  A2: for x,y being Point of M holds dist(f.x,f.y)<=L*dist(x,y) by Def1;

A6: {x where x is Point of M:_P[x]}is Subset of M from DOMAIN_1:sch 7;

  proof
   thus F <> {} by A4,A5,A6;
   let G be set

       G is c=-linear
   proof
   let B,C be set; assume B in G & C in G;

   A14: for n,m being Nat st n<=m holds L to_power m <= L to_power n
   proof
    let n,m be Nat such that A15:n<=m;
        now per cases by A15,REAL_1:def 5;
    suppose n<m;
     hence L to_power n >= L to_power m by A1,POWER:45;
    end;

   thus C c= B
    proof

    thus B c= C
    proof
     let y be set;
