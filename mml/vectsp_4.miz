     reconsider C = v + W as Coset of W by Def6;
   take C;
   thus thesis by A2;
  end;

theorem
    u in B & u in C implies B = C
  proof assume A1: u in B & u in C;
 A2:    ex v1 st B = v1 + W by Def6;
        ex v2 st C = v2 + W by Def6;
   hence thesis by A1,A2,Th71;
  end;

theorem
    for GF be add-associative right_zeroed right_complementable
    Abelian commutative associative left_unital distributive
         (non empty doubleLoopStr),
     V be Abelian add-associative right_zeroed
          right_complementable VectSp-like (non empty VectSpStr over GF),
  a,b being Element of GF,
  v being Element of V
  holds (a - b) * v = a * v - b * v by Lm1;
