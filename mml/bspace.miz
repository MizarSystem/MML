  set V = bspace(X);
  set S = singletons(X);
  for v being Element of V holds v in Lin(S)
  proof
    let v be Element of V;
    reconsider f = v as Subset of X;
    consider A being set such that
A1: A c= X and
A2: f = A;
    reconsider A as Subset of X by A1;
    ex l being Linear_Combination of S st Sum l = A by Th39;
    hence thesis by A2,VECTSP_7:12;

  hence thesis by VECTSP_4:40;

theorem Th41:
  for X being finite set holds singletons(X) is Basis of bspace(X)
proof
  let X be finite set;
  singletons(X) is linearly-independent & Lin(singletons(X)) = bspace(X)
  by Th37,Th40;
  hence thesis by VECTSP_7:def 3;

registration
  let X be finite set;

  proof
    set S = singletons(X);
    S is Basis of bspace(X) by Th41;

theorem
  card (singletons X) = card X
proof
  defpred P[set,set] means $1 in X & $2 = {$1};
A1: for x being set st x in X holds ex y being set st P[x,y];
  consider f being Function such that
A2: dom f = X and
A3: for x being set st x in X holds P[x,f.x] from CLASSES1:sch 1(A1);
A4: rng f = singletons(X)
  proof
    thus rng f c= singletons(X)
    proof
      let y be set;
      assume
      y in rng f;
      then consider x being set such that
A5:   x in dom f and
A6:   y = f.x by FUNCT_1:def 5;
A7:   f.x = {x} by A2,A3,A5;
      then reconsider fx = f.x as Subset of X by A2,A5,ZFMISC_1:37;
      fx is Singleton by A7;
      hence thesis by A6;
    end;
    let y be set such that
A8: y in singletons(X);
A9: ex z being Subset of X st y = z & z is Singleton by A8;
    reconsider y as Subset of X by A8;
    consider x being set such that
A10: x in X and
A11: y = {x} by A9,Def9;
    reconsider x as Element of X by A10;
    y = f.x by A3,A10,A11;
    hence thesis by A2,A10,FUNCT_1:12;
  end;
  f is one-to-one
  proof
    let x1,x2 be set such that
A12: x1 in dom f & x2 in dom f and
A13: f.x1 = f.x2;
    ( P[x1,f.x1])& P[x2,f.x2] by A2,A3,A12;
    hence thesis by A13,ZFMISC_1:6;
  end;
  then X,singletons(X) are_equipotent by A2,A4,WELLORD2:def 4;
  hence thesis by CARD_1:21;
end;

theorem
  card [#](bspace X) = exp(2,card(X)) by CARD_2:44;

theorem
  dim bspace {} = 0
proof
  card [#]bspace {} = 1 by CARD_2:60,ZFMISC_1:1;
  hence thesis by RANKNULL:5;
