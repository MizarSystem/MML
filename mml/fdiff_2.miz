theorem Th1:
  a is convergent & b is convergent & lim a = lim b & (for n holds
  d.(2*n) = a.n & d.(2*n + 1) = b.n) implies d is convergent & lim d = lim a
proof
  assume that
A1: a is convergent and
A2: b is convergent and
A3: lim a = lim b and
A4: for n holds d.(2*n) = a.n & d.(2*n+1) = b.n;
A5: now
    let r be real number;
    assume
A6: 0<r;
    then consider k1 be Element of NAT such that
A7: for m st k1 <= m holds abs(a.m - lim a) < r by A1,SEQ_2:def 7;
    consider k2 be Element of NAT such that
A8: for m st k2 <= m holds abs(b.m - lim b) < r by A2,A6,SEQ_2:def 7;
    take n = max(2*k1,2*k2+1);
    let m;
    assume
A9: n<=m;
    then
A10: 2*k2 + 1 <= m by XXREAL_0:30;
    consider n such that
A11: m = 2*n or m = 2*n + 1 by SCHEME1:1;
A12: 2*k1 <= m by A9,XXREAL_0:30;
    now
      per cases by A11;
      suppose
A13:    m = 2*n;
        then
A14:    n >= k1 by A12,XREAL_1:70;
        abs(d.m - lim a) = abs(a.n - lim a) by A4,A13;
        hence abs(d.m - lim a) < r by A7,A14;
      end;
      suppose
A15:    m = 2*n + 1;
A16:    now
          assume
          n < k2;
          then 2*n < 2*k2 by XREAL_1:70;
          hence contradiction by A10,A15,XREAL_1:8;
        end;
        abs(d.m - lim a) = abs(b.n - lim a) by A4,A15;
        hence abs(d.m - lim a) < r by A3,A8,A16;
      end;
    end;
    hence abs(d.m - lim a) < r;
  end;
  hence d is convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
  hence thesis by A5,SEQ_2:def 7;
end;

theorem Th2:
  (for n holds a.n = 2*n) implies a is increasing sequence of NAT
proof
  assume
A1: for n holds a.n = 2*n;
A2: a is increasing
  proof
    let n;
A3: 2*n + 0 < 2*n + 2 by XREAL_1:10;
    2*n + 2 = 2*(n + 1)
      .= a.(n + 1) by A1;
    hence a.n < a.(n+1) by A1,A3;
  end;
A4: now
    let x;
    assume
    x in NAT;
    then reconsider n = x as Element of NAT;
    a.n = 2*n by A1;
    hence a.x in NAT;
  end;
  dom a = NAT by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  hence thesis by A2,A4,FUNCT_2:5;
end;

theorem Th3:
  (for n holds a.n = 2*n + 1) implies a is increasing sequence of
  NAT
proof
  assume
A1: for n holds a.n = 2*n + 1;
A2: a is increasing
  proof
    let n;
A3: 2*n + 1+0 < 2*n + 1+2 by XREAL_1:10;
    2*n + 1+2 = 2*(n + 1) + 1
      .= a.(n + 1) by A1;
    hence a.n < a.(n+1) by A1,A3;
  end;
A4: now
    let x;
    assume
    x in dom a;
    then reconsider n = x as Element of NAT;
    a.n = 2*n+1 by A1;
    hence a.x in NAT;
  end;
  dom a = NAT by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  hence thesis by A2,A4,FUNCT_2:5;
end;

theorem Th4:
  rng c = {x0} implies c is convergent & lim c = x0 & h + c is
  convergent & lim(h + c) = x0
proof
  assume
A1: rng c = {x0};
  thus c is convergent;
  x0 in rng c by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
  hence
A2: lim c = x0 by SEQ_4:40;
A3: h is convergent by FDIFF_1:def 1;
  hence h + c is convergent by SEQ_2:19;
  lim h = 0 by FDIFF_1:def 1;
  hence lim (h + c) = 0 + x0 by A2,A3,SEQ_2:20
    .= x0;
end;

theorem Th5:
  rng a = {r} & rng b = {r} implies a = b
proof
  assume that
A1: rng a = {r} and
A2: rng b = {r};
  now
    let n;
    a.n in rng a by VALUED_0:28;
    then
A3: a.n = r by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
    b.n in rng b by VALUED_0:28;
    hence a.n = b.n by A2,A3,TARSKI:def 1;
  end;
  hence thesis by FUNCT_2:113;
end;

theorem Th6:
  a is subsequence of h implies a is convergent_to_0 Real_Sequence
proof
  assume
A1: a is subsequence of h;
  then consider I be increasing sequence of NAT such that
A2: a = h*I by VALUED_0:def 17;
A3: h is non-zero by FDIFF_1:def 1;
  now
    given n such that
A4: a.n = 0;
    h.(I.n) <> 0 by A3,SEQ_1:7;
    hence contradiction by A2,A4,FUNCT_2:21;
  end;
  then
A5: a is non-zero by SEQ_1:7;
A6: h is convergent by FDIFF_1:def 1;
  then
A7: a is convergent by A1,SEQ_4:29;
  lim h = 0 by FDIFF_1:def 1;
  then lim a = 0 by A1,A6,SEQ_4:30;
  hence thesis by A7,A5,FDIFF_1:def 1;
end;
