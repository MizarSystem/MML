begin :: Preliminaries

 reserve x,a for real number;
 reserve p,q for Point of TOP-REAL 2;
Lm1:p <> 0.REAL 2 implies |.p.| > 0
proof
  assume p <> 0.REAL 2;
then |.p.| <> 0 by TOPRNS_1:25;
  hence thesis by TOPRNS_1:26;
end;

theorem Th2: a>=0 & (x-a)*(x+a)<0 implies -a<x & x<a by XREAL_1:96;

theorem Th3: for sn being real number st -1<sn & sn<1 holds 1+sn>0 & 1-sn>0
             by XREAL_1:150,151;

theorem Th4: for a being real number st a^2<=1 holds -1<=a & a<=1
proof let a be real number;assume a^2<=1;
  then a^2-1^2<=1^2-1^2 by REAL_1:49,SQUARE_1:59;

theorem Th5: for a being real number st a^2<1 holds -1<a & a<1
proof let a be real number;assume a^2<1;
  then a^2-1^2<1^2-1^2 by REAL_1:54,SQUARE_1:59;
  then (a-1)*(a+1)<0 by SQUARE_1:67;
 hence -1<a & a<1 by Th2;
