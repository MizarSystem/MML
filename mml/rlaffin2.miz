reserve x,y for set,
        r,s for Real,
        n for Nat,
        V for RealLinearSpace,
        v,u,w,p for VECTOR of V,
        A,B for Subset of V,
        Af for finite Subset of V,
        I for affinely-independent Subset of V,
        If for finite affinely-independent Subset of V,
        F for Subset-Family of V,
        L1,L2 for Linear_Combination of V;

Lm1: r<>1 & r*u+(1-r)*w=v implies w=(1/(1-r)*v)+(1-1/(1-r))*u
  proof
    assume that

    A3: (1-r)*w = v-r*u by A2,RLVECT_4:1;
    A4: 1-r<>1-1 by A1;
    then A5: (1/(1-r))*(1-r)=1 by XCMPLX_1:107;
    A6: 1/(1-r)*(r*u)=(1/(1-r)*r)*u by RLVECT_1:def 10
                    .=((1-(1-r))/(1-r))*u by XCMPLX_1:100

                    .=(1/(1-r)-1)*u by A4,XCMPLX_1:60;
    thus w=1*w by RLVECT_1:def 11

         .=(1/(1-r)*v)-1/(1-r)*(r*u) by A3,RLVECT_1:48
