theorem Th1:
0<a & a<1 & (for n holds s.n=a to_power (n+1)) implies
s is convergent & lim s = 0
  proof assume that A1: 0<a & a<1 and
 A2: for n holds s.n=a to_power (n+1);
  set r = 1/a - 1;
      1/a > 1 by A1,Lm1,REAL_2:151;
 then A3: r > 0 by XREAL_1:52;
 then A4: -1 < r;
 A5: for p be real number st 0 < p
    ex m st for n st m<=n holds abs(s.n - 0) < p
    proof let p be real number; assume
   A6: 0<p;
   then A7: 1/p > 0 by REAL_2:127;
   A8: 1/(p * r) = 1/p/r by XCMPLX_1:79;
       [\1/(p * r)/] is Nat
     proof
        p * r > 0 by A3,A6,REAL_2:122;
    then A9: 1/(p * r) > 0 by REAL_2:127;
        1/(p * r) <= [\1/(p * r)/] + 1 by INT_1:52;
    then 0 < [\1/(p * r)/] + 1 by A9;
     then 0 <= [\1/(p * r)/] by INT_1:20;
     hence [\1/(p * r)/] is Nat by INT_1:16;
     end;
    then consider m such that
   A10: m = [\1/(p * r)/];
    take m;
       now let n such that A11: m<=n;
       [\1/(p * r)/] > 1/(p * r) -1 by INT_1:def 4;
    then n > 1/(p * r) - 1 by A10,A11,XREAL_1:2;
    then n + 1 > 1/p/r by A8,XREAL_1:21;
   then A12: (n+1) * r > 1/p by A3,REAL_2:177;
       a to_power (n+1) > 0 by A1,POWER:39;
   then A13: abs(a to_power (n+1)) = a to_power (n+1) by ABSVALUE:def 1;
   A14: 1 + (n+1) * r <= (1 + r) to_power (n + 1) by A4,POWER:56;
   A15: (1+r) to_power (n+1) = 1 to_power (n+1) / a to_power (n+1) by A1,
POWER:36
             .= 1 / a to_power (n+1) by POWER:31;
        0 + (n+1) * r < 1 + (n+1) * r by XREAL_1:8;
     then 1/p < 1 + (n+1) * r by A12,XREAL_1:2;
     then 1/p < 1/ a to_power (n+1) by A14,A15,XREAL_1:2;
     then abs(a to_power (n+1)) < p by A7,A13,REAL_2:154; hence
        abs(s.n - 0) < p by A2;
    end; hence thesis;
    end;
  hence s is convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
  hence lim s = 0 by A5,SEQ_2:def 7;
  end;

theorem Th2:
a <> 0 implies abs(a) to_power n = abs(a to_power n)
  proof assume A1: a <> 0;
 then A2: abs(a) > 0 by COMPLEX1:133;
      now per cases by A1;
   suppose A3: a>0;
  then A4: a to_power n = abs(a) to_power n by ABSVALUE:def 1;
       a to_power n > 0 by A3,POWER:39;
   hence abs(a) to_power n = abs(a to_power n) by A4,ABSVALUE:def 1;
   end;
   suppose A5: a < 0;
   A6: ex k st n = 2 * k or n = 2 * k + 1 by SCHEME1:1;
   reconsider m=n as Integer;
        now per cases by A6;
     suppose A7: (ex k being Integer st m = 2 * k);
     A8: abs(a) to_power n = (-a) to_power m by A5,ABSVALUE:def 1
      .= a to_power m by A1,A7,POWER:54;
         abs(a) to_power n > 0 by A2,POWER:39; hence
         abs(a) to_power n = abs(a to_power n ) by A8,ABSVALUE:def 1;
     end;
     suppose A9: (ex k being Integer st m = 2 * k + 1);
      A10: abs(a) to_power n = (-a) to_power m by A5,ABSVALUE:def 1
      .= - a to_power m by A1,A9,POWER:55;
         abs(a) to_power n > 0 by A2,POWER:39; hence
         abs(a) to_power n = abs( - a to_power n ) by A10,ABSVALUE:def 1
      .= abs( a to_power n ) by COMPLEX1:138;
     end;
     end; hence abs(a) to_power n = abs(a to_power n);
   end;
   end; hence thesis;
  end;

theorem Th3:
abs(a)<1 & (for n holds s.n=a to_power (n+1)) implies
s is convergent & lim s = 0
  proof assume that A1: abs(a) < 1 and
 A2: for n holds s.n=a to_power (n+1);
     now per cases;
  suppose abs(a) = 0;
  then A3: a = 0 by ABSVALUE:7;
  A4: now let n;
      a to_power (n+1) = 0 by A3,POWER:def 2; hence
         s.n = 0 by A2;
      end; then A5: s is constant by SEQM_3:def 6;
       s.0 = 0 by A4;
  hence s is convergent & lim s = 0 by A5,SEQ_4:39,41;
  end;
  suppose A6:not abs(a) = 0; then A7: a <> 0 by ABSVALUE:7;
      abs(a) >= 0 by COMPLEX1:132;
  then A8: abs(a) > 0 by A6;
  deffunc U(Nat) = abs(a) to_power ($1+1);
  consider s1 such that
  A9: for n holds s1.n = U(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
  A10: s1 is convergent & lim s1 = 0 by A1,A8,A9,Th1;
        now let n;
     thus s1.n = abs(a) to_power (n+1) by A9
         .= abs(a to_power (n+1)) by A7,Th2
         .= abs(s.n) by A2;
     end;
    then abs(s) is convergent & lim abs(s) = 0 by A10,SEQ_1:16; hence
      s is convergent & lim s = 0 by SEQ_4:28;
  end;
  end; hence thesis;
  end;

definition let s;

existence
proof deffunc U(Nat,Real) = $2 + s.($1+1);
 consider f being Function of NAT,REAL such that
 A1: f.0 = s.0 & for n being Nat holds f.(n+1) = U(n,f.n) from RECDEF_1:sch 4;
 reconsider f as Real_Sequence;
 take f;
 thus thesis by A1;
end;
uniqueness
proof
 let s1,s2;
 assume that A2: s1.0=s.0 & for n holds s1.(n+1)=s1.n + s.(n+1) and
             A3: s2.0=s.0 & for n holds s2.(n+1)=s2.n + s.(n+1);
  defpred X[Nat] means s1.$1 = s2.$1;
 A4: X[0] by A2,A3;
 A5: for k st X[k] holds X[k+1]
     proof let k;
      assume s1.k =s2.k;
      hence s1.(k+1) = s2.k + s.(k+1) by A2
                    .= s2.(k+1) by A3;
     end;
    for n holds X[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A4,A5);
 hence s1 = s2 by FUNCT_2:113;

theorem Th7:
s is summable implies s is convergent & lim s = 0
proof
 assume s is summable;
 then A1: Partial_Sums(s) is convergent by Def2;
 then A2: Partial_Sums(s) ^\1 is convergent &
    lim(Partial_Sums(s) ^\1) = lim(Partial_Sums(s)) by SEQ_4:33;
 then A3: lim(Partial_Sums(s) ^\1 - Partial_Sums(s))
     = lim(Partial_Sums(s)) - lim(Partial_Sums(s)) by A1,SEQ_2:26
    .= 0;
 A4: s ^\1 = Partial_Sums(s) ^\1 - Partial_Sums(s)
    proof
        now let n;
         (Partial_Sums(s)).(n+1) = (Partial_Sums(s)).n + s.(n+1) by Def1;
      then (Partial_Sums(s)).(n+1) = (Partial_Sums(s)).n + (s ^\1).n
        by SEQM_3:def 9;
      hence (Partial_Sums(s) ^\1).n = (Partial_Sums(s)).n + (s ^\1).n
        by SEQM_3:def 9;
     end;
     then A5: (Partial_Sums(s) ^\1) = Partial_Sums(s) + s ^\1 by SEQ_1:11;
        s ^\1 + (Partial_Sums(s) - Partial_Sums(s)) = s ^\1
      proof
          now let n;
       thus (s ^\1 + (Partial_Sums(s) - Partial_Sums(s))).n
        = (s ^\1).n + (Partial_Sums(s) - Partial_Sums(s)).n by SEQ_1:11
       .= (s ^\1).n + (Partial_Sums(s) +- Partial_Sums(s)).n by SEQ_1:15

       .= (s ^\1).n;
       end;
      hence thesis by FUNCT_2:113;
      end;
     hence thesis by A5,SEQ_1:39;
    end;
 then A6: s ^\1 is convergent by A1,A2,SEQ_2:25; hence
    s is convergent by SEQ_4:35;
 thus thesis by A3,A4,A6,SEQ_4:36;
end;

theorem Th8:
Partial_Sums(s1) + Partial_Sums(s2) = Partial_Sums(s1+s2)

 .= s1.0 + Partial_Sums(s2).0 by Def1
 .= s1.0 + s2.0 by Def1
 .= (s1+s2).0 by SEQ_1:11;
     now let n; thus

theorem
   s1 is summable & s2 is summable implies
s1+s2 is summable & Sum(s1+s2) = Sum(s1) + Sum(s2)
proof assume A1: s1 is summable & s2 is summable;
 then A2: Partial_Sums(s1) is convergent by Def2;
 A3: Partial_Sums(s2) is convergent by A1,Def2;
 then Partial_Sums(s1) + Partial_Sums(s2) is convergent by A2,SEQ_2:19;
 then Partial_Sums(s1+s2) is convergent by Th8;
 hence s1+s2 is summable by Def2;

theorem
   (for n holds s1.n = n-root (abs(s).n)) & s1 is convergent & lim s1 < 1
implies s is absolutely_summable
proof assume that A1: for n holds s1.n = n-root (abs(s).n) and
