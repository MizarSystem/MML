begin  :: The Continuity of Lattices

reserve x, y, i for set,
  L for up-complete Semilattice;

Lm1: for L being continuous Semilattice for x being Element of L holds
waybelow x is Ideal of L & x <= sup waybelow x & for I being Ideal of L st x <=
sup I holds waybelow x c= I

proof
  let L be continuous Semilattice;
  let x be Element of L;
  thus waybelow x is Ideal of L;
  thus x <= sup waybelow x by WAYBEL_3:def 5;
  thus for I being Ideal of L st x <= sup I holds waybelow x c= I
  proof
    let I be Ideal of L;
    assume
A1: x <= sup I;
    waybelow x c= I
    proof
      let y be set;
      assume
      y in waybelow x;
      then y in {y' where y' is Element of L: y' << x} by WAYBEL_3:def 3;
      then ex y' being Element of L st y = y' & y' << x;
      hence thesis by A1,WAYBEL_3:20;
    end;
    hence thesis;
  end;
end;

Lm2: (for x being Element of L holds waybelow x is Ideal of L & x <= sup
waybelow x & for I being Ideal of L st x <= sup I holds waybelow x c= I)
implies L is continuous

proof
  assume

A1: for x being Element of L holds waybelow x is Ideal of L & x <= sup
  waybelow x & for I being Ideal of L st x <= sup I holds waybelow x c= I;

  now
    let x be Element of L;
A2: x <= sup waybelow x by A1;
    waybelow x is non empty directed by A1;
    then
A3: ex_sup_of waybelow x,L by WAYBEL_0:75;
    waybelow x is_<=_than x by WAYBEL_3:9;
    then sup waybelow x <= x by A3,YELLOW_0:def 9;
    hence x = sup waybelow x by A2,YELLOW_0:def 3;
  end;
  then
A4: L is satisfying_axiom_of_approximation by WAYBEL_3:def 5;
  for x being Element of L holds waybelow x is non empty directed by A1;
  hence thesis by A4,WAYBEL_3:def 6;
end;

theorem ::Theorem 2.1 (1) iff (2)
  L is continuous iff for x being Element of L holds waybelow x is Ideal
  of L & x <= sup waybelow x & for I being Ideal of L st x <= sup I holds
  waybelow x c= I by Lm1,Lm2;

Lm3: L is continuous implies for x being Element of L ex I being Ideal of L st
x <= sup I & for J being Ideal of L st x <= sup J holds I c= J

proof
  assume
A1: L is continuous;
  let x be Element of L;
  reconsider I = waybelow x as Ideal of L by A1;
  take I;
  thus thesis by A1,Lm1;
end;

Lm4: (for x being Element of L ex I being Ideal of L st x <= sup I & for J
being Ideal of L st x <= sup J holds I c= J) implies L is continuous

proof
  assume

A1: for x being Element of L ex I being Ideal of L st x <= sup I & for J
  being Ideal of L st x <= sup J holds I c= J;

  now
    let x be Element of L;
    consider I being Ideal of L such that
A2: x <= sup I and
A3: for J being Ideal of L st x <= sup J holds I c= J by A1;
    now

      assume
A4:   y in I;
      then reconsider y'= y as Element of L;
      for J being Ideal of L st x <= sup J holds y in J
      proof
        let J be Ideal of L;
        assume
        x <= sup J;
        then I c= J by A3;
        hence thesis by A4;
      end;
      then y' << x by WAYBEL_3:21;
      hence y in waybelow x by WAYBEL_3:7;
    end;
    then
A5: I c= waybelow x by TARSKI:def 3;
    now
      let y be set;
      assume
A6:   y in waybelow x;
      then reconsider y'= y as Element of L;
      y' << x by A6,WAYBEL_3:7;
      hence y in I by A2,WAYBEL_3:20;
    end;
    then waybelow x c= I by TARSKI:def 3;
    then waybelow x = I by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;

    hence
    waybelow x is Ideal of L & x <= sup waybelow x & for I being Ideal of
    L st x <= sup I holds waybelow x c= I by A2,A3;

  end;
  hence thesis by Lm2;
