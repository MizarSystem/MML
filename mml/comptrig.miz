  then n >= 0+1 & 0|^n = x by Def2,NAT_1:13;
  hence thesis by NEWTON:16;
end;

theorem
  for a being real number st 0 <= a & a < 2*PI & cos(a) = 1 holds a = 0
proof
  let a be real number such that
A1: 0 <= a & a < 2*PI and
A2: cos(a) = 1;
  1*1+(sin a)*(sin a) = 1 by A2,SIN_COS:32;
  then sin a = 0;
  hence thesis by A1,A2,Th33,SIN_COS:82;
end;

theorem
  for z being complex number holds z = |.z.|*cos Arg z + |.z.|*sin Arg z * <i>
proof
  let z be complex number;
  per cases;
  suppose
    z = 0;
    hence thesis by COMPLEX1:130;
  end;
  suppose
    z <> 0;
    hence thesis by Def1;
  end;
