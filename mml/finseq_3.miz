theorem Th7X:
  for A being set, i being Nat holds i <> 0 & A = {} iff
  i-tuples_on A = {}
proof
  let A be set, i be Nat;
  hereby
    assume
    i <> 0;
    then 0 < i by NAT_1:3;
    then
A1: 0+1 <= i by NAT_1:13;
    assume that
A2: A = {} and
A3: i-tuples_on A <> {};
    reconsider B = i-tuples_on A as non empty FinSequenceSet of A by A3;
    consider p being Element of B;
    B = {s where s is Element of A*: len s = i} & p in B by FINSEQ_2:def 4;
    then
Y:    ex s being Element of A* st p = s & len s = i;
    then 1 in dom p by A1,Th27;
    then dom p <> {};
    then
X:    rng p <> {} by RELAT_1:65;
     rng p c= A by Y,FINSEQ_1:def 4;
    hence contradiction by A2,X;
  end;
  assume that
A4: i-tuples_on A = {} and
A5: i = 0 or A <> {};
  len (<*>A) = 0;
  then reconsider A as non empty set by A4,A5,FINSEQ_2:153;
  i-tuples_on A is non empty;
  hence contradiction by A4;
