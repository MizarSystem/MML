        proof
          now
            per cases;
            case
              not S-Poly(g1,g2,T) in field PolyRedRel(G,T);
              hence thesis by REWRITE1:47;
            end;
            case
              S-Poly(g1,g2,T) in field PolyRedRel(G,T);
              hence thesis by REWRITE1:def 14;
            end;
          end;
          hence thesis;
        end;
        then consider h being set such that
A9:     h is_a_normal_form_of S-Poly(g1,g2,T),PolyRedRel(G,T) by
REWRITE1:def 11;
        PolyRedRel(G,T) reduces S-Poly(g1,g2,T),h by A9,REWRITE1:def 6;
        then reconsider h as Polynomial of n,L by Lm1;
        h = 0_(n,L) by A2,A3,A4,A8,A9;
        hence thesis by A9,REWRITE1:def 6;
      end;
    end;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1,GROEB_2:30;
