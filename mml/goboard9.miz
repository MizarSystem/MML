        Int left_cell(f,k+1) misses L~f by A4,A5,GOBOARD8:37;

theorem
    GoB Rev f = GoB f by Lm1;

theorem Th26:
 RightComp f = LeftComp Rev f
proof
     LeftComp Rev f is_a_component_of (L~Rev f)` by Def1;
then A1: LeftComp Rev f is_a_component_of (L~f)` by SPPOL_2:22;
   A2: len f >= 4 by GOBOARD7:36;
then A3: len f >= 1+1 by AXIOMS:22;
      len f >= 1 by A2,AXIOMS:22;
then A4: len f -' 1 + 1 = len f by AMI_5:4;
then A5: 1 <= len f -' 1 by A3,REAL_1:53;
A6: len f -' 1 + 1 <= len Rev f by A4,FINSEQ_5:def 3;
     right_cell(f,1) = left_cell(Rev f,len f -' 1) by A4,A5,Th13;
  then Int right_cell(f,1) c= LeftComp Rev f by A5,A6,Th24;
 hence thesis by A1,Def2;

theorem
    RightComp Rev f = LeftComp f
proof Rev Rev f = f by FINSEQ_6:29;
 hence thesis by Th26;

theorem
    for k st 1 <= k & k+1 <= len f holds Int right_cell(f,k) c= RightComp f
proof let k such that
A1: 1 <= k & k+1 <= len f;
A2: len f = len Rev f by FINSEQ_5:def 3;
      k <= len f by A1,NAT_1:38;
   then A3:  len f-'k+k = len f by AMI_5:4;
then A4: 1 <= len f-'k & len f-'k+1 <= len f by A1,AXIOMS:24,REAL_1:53;
   then A5: right_cell(f,k) = left_cell(Rev f,len f-'k) by A1,A3,Th13;
     RightComp f = LeftComp Rev f by Th26;
 hence Int right_cell(f,k) c= RightComp f by A2,A4,A5,Th24;
