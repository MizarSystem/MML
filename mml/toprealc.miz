theorem Th2:
  f(#)(c1+c2) = f(#)c1 + f(#)c2
  proof
A1: dom (f(#)(c1+c2)) = dom f by VALUED_1:def 5;
A2: dom (f(#)c1) = dom f by VALUED_1:def 5;
A3: dom (f(#)c2) = dom f by VALUED_1:def 5;
A4: dom (f(#)c1 + f(#)c2) = dom (f(#)c1) /\ dom (f(#)c2) by VALUED_1:def 1;
    hence dom (f(#)(c1+c2)) = dom (f(#)c1 + f(#)c2) by A2,A3,VALUED_1:def 5;
    let x;
    assume

A4: dom ((f+g)(/)c) = dom (f+g) by VALUED_2:28;
A5: dom (f+g) = dom f /\ dom g by VALUED_1:def 1;

    let x;
    assume
A6: x in dom (f(/)c + g(/)c);

theorem
  c1 <> 0 & c2 <> 0 implies f(/)c1 - g(/)c2 = (f(#)c2-g(#)c1) (/) (c1*c2)

A7: dom (f(#)c2-g(#)c1) = dom (f(#)c2) /\ dom (g(#)c1) by VALUED_1:12;

theorem
  (c-d)(#)f = c(#)f - d(#)f
  proof
    dom(c(#)f - d(#)f) = dom(c(#)f) /\ dom(d(#)f) by VALUED_1:12
    .= dom f /\ dom(d(#)f) by VALUED_1:def 5

    let x be set;
    assume
A2: x in dom((c-d)(#)f);

A2: dom(g-f) = dom g /\ dom f by VALUED_1:12;
A3: dom((f-g)^2) = dom(f-g) by VALUED_1:11;

    let x be set;

A6: (g-f).x = g.x - f.x by A1,A3,A4,A2,VALUED_1:13;

theorem
  (f(/)c)^2 = f^2 (/) c^2
