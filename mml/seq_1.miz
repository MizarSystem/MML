theorem Th3:
  f is Real_Sequence iff (dom f=NAT & for x st x in NAT holds f.x is real)
proof
  thus f is Real_Sequence implies (dom f=NAT & for x st x in NAT holds f.x is
  real) by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  assume that
A1: dom f= NAT and
A2: for x st x in NAT holds f.x is real;
  now

A4: y=f.x by FUNCT_1:def 5;
    f.x is real by A1,A2,A3;
    hence y in REAL by A4,XREAL_0:def 1;

proof
  let f be non-zero PartFunc of NAT,REAL;

  proof
    assume
A1: seq is non-zero;
    let x;
    assume x in NAT;
    then x in dom seq by Th4;
    then seq.x in rng seq by FUNCT_1:def 5;
