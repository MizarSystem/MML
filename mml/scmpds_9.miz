begin :: Preliminaries

reserve r, s for real number;

theorem Th1:
  0 <= r + abs(r)
  proof
A1: 0 <= abs(r) by ABSVALUE:5;
    then A2: 0 + abs(r) <= abs(r) + abs(r) by AXIOMS:24;
    abs(r) + abs(r) = r + abs(r) or abs(r) + r = -r + r by ABSVALUE:1;
    hence thesis by A1,A2;
  end;

theorem Th2:
  0 <= -r + abs(r)
  proof
    r <= abs(r) by COMPLEX1:162;
    then -r >= -abs(r) by REAL_1:50;
    then -r+abs(r) >= -abs(r)+abs(r) by REAL_1:55;
    hence thesis;
  end;

theorem Th3:
  abs(r) = abs(s) implies r = s or r = -s
  proof
    assume
A1:   abs(r) = abs(s);
    assume
A2:   r <> s;
    per cases by ABSVALUE:1;
    suppose abs(r) = r & abs(s) = s;
    hence r = -s by A1,A2;
    end;
    suppose abs(r) = r & abs(s) = -s;
    hence r = -s by A1;
    end;
    suppose abs(r) = -r & abs(s) = s;
    hence r = -s by A1;
    end;
    suppose abs(r) = -r & abs(s) = -s;
    hence r = -s by A1,A2,XCMPLX_1:134;
  end;
  end;

theorem Th4:
  for i, j being natural number st i < j & i <> 0 holds
    i/j is not integer
  proof
    let i, j be natural number such that
A1:   i < j and
A2:   i <> 0;
A3: i >= 0 by NAT_1:19;
    assume i/j is integer;
    then reconsider r = i/j as Integer;
 i is Nat & j is Nat by ORDINAL2:def 21;
    then i div j = 0 by A1,JORDAN4:5;
    then A4:   i qua Integer div j = 0 by SCMFSA9A:5;
     r = [\ r /] by INT_1:47
     .= i qua Integer div j by INT_1:def 7;
    hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,A4,XCMPLX_1:50;
  end;

theorem Th5:
  {2*k where k is Nat: k > 1} is infinite
  proof
    set X = {2*k where k is Nat: k > 1};
    assume
A1:   X is finite;
A2: X c= NAT
    proof
      let x be set;
      assume x in X;
      then ex k being Nat st x = 2*k & k > 1;
      hence thesis;
    end;
     2*2 in X;
    then reconsider X as non empty finite Subset of NAT by A1,A2;
    set m = max X;
     m in X by PRE_CIRC:def 1;
    then consider k being Nat such that
A3:   m = 2*k and
A4:   k > 1;
A5: m+2 = 2*(k+1) by A3;
     k+1 > k+0 by REAL_1:67;
    then k+1 > 1 by A4,AXIOMS:22;
    then m+2 in X by A5;
    then m+2 <= m+0 by PRE_CIRC:def 1;
    hence contradiction by REAL_1:67;
  end;

theorem Th6:
  for f being Function, a,b,c being set st a <> c holds
    (f +* (a.-->b)).c = f.c
  proof
    let f be Function,
        a,b,c be set such that
A1: a <> c;
    set g = a.-->b;
    dom g = {a} by CQC_LANG:5;
    then not c in dom g by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
    hence (f +* g).c = f.c by FUNCT_4:12;
  end;

theorem Th7:
  for f being Function, a,b,c,d being set st a <> b holds
   (f +* ((a,b)-->(c,d))) .a = c &
   (f +* ((a,b)-->(c,d))) .b = d
  proof
    let f be Function,
        a,b,c,d be set such that
A1:   a <> b;
    set g = (a,b)-->(c,d);
A2: dom g = {a,b} by FUNCT_4:65;
    then a in dom g by TARSKI:def 2;
    hence (f +* g).a = g.a by FUNCT_4:14
     .= c by A1,FUNCT_4:66;
     b in dom g by A2,TARSKI:def 2;
    hence (f +* g).b = g.b by FUNCT_4:14
     .= d by A1,FUNCT_4:66;
  end;

  proof
     a is Element of INT & b is Element of INT &
    ObjectKind la = INT & ObjectKind lb = INT by INT_1:def 2,SCMPDS_2:13;

uniqueness
  proof
    let m, n be natural number such that

    reconsider m,n as Nat by ORDINAL2:def 21;
     l = inspos m & l = inspos n by A2,SCMPDS_3:def 2;

  redefine func locnum l -> Nat;
coherence by ORDINAL2:def 21;
end;

theorem Th8:
  l = 2*locnum l + 2

      .= l by Def1;
  end;

theorem

  proof

  proof
    assume
A1:   SCMPDS is InsLoc-antisymmetric;
     SUCC(inspos(1)) = the Instruction-Locations of SCMPDS &
    SUCC(inspos(2)) = the Instruction-Locations of SCMPDS by Th29;
    then inspos(1) <= inspos(2) & inspos(2) <= inspos(1) by Th30;
    then inspos(1) = inspos(2) by A1,AMISTD_1:def 9;
    hence thesis by SCMPDS_3:31;
