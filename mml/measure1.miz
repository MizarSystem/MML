begin :: Some useful theorems about sets and R_eal numbers

reserve X for set;

theorem Th1:
  for X,Y being set holds union {X,Y,{}} = union {X,Y}
proof
  let X,Y be set;
  thus union {X,Y,{}} = union ({X,Y} \/ {{}}) by ENUMSET1:3
    .= union {X,Y} \/ union {{}} by ZFMISC_1:78
    .= union {X,Y} \/ {} by ZFMISC_1:25
    .= union {X,Y};
end;

theorem
  for A,B being Subset of X holds {A,B} is Subset-Family of X
proof
  let A,B be Subset of X;
  set C = {A,B};
  C c= bool X
  proof
    let x be set;
    assume x in C;
    then x = A or x = B by TARSKI:def 2;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem
  for A,B,C being Subset of X holds {A,B,C} is Subset-Family of X
proof
  let A,B,C be Subset of X;
  set D = {A,B,C};
  D c= bool X
  proof
    let x be set;
    assume x in D;
    then x = A or x = B or x = C by ENUMSET1:def 1;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

  end;
  then reconsider X as non empty Subset-Family of A() by A1,A2;
  take X;
  for B being set holds B in X iff B c= A() & P[B]
  proof
    let B be set;
    thus B in X implies B c= A() & P[B]
    proof

theorem
  for S being SigmaField of X, M being sigma_Measure of S, A,B being
measure_zero of M holds A \/ B is measure_zero of M & A /\ B is measure_zero of
  M & A \ B is measure_zero of M
proof
  let S be SigmaField of X, M be sigma_Measure of S, A,B be measure_zero of M;
