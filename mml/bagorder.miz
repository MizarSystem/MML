begin :: Preliminaries

theorem Th1:
  for x,y,z being set st z in x & z in y holds x \ {z} = y \ {z} implies x = y
proof
  let x,y,z be set;
  assume that
A1: z in x and
A2: z in y;
  assume
A3: x \ {z} = y \ {z};
  thus x = x \/ {z} by A1,ZFMISC_1:46
    .= (y \ {z}) \/ {z} by A3,XBOOLE_1:39
    .= y \/ {z} by XBOOLE_1:39
    .= y by A2,ZFMISC_1:46;
end;

theorem
  for n, k being Element of NAT holds k in Seg n
  iff k-1 is Element of NAT & k-1 < n
proof
  let n, k be Element of NAT;
A1: Seg n = {x where x is Element of NAT : 1 <= x & x <= n} by FINSEQ_1:def 1;
  hereby
    assume k in Seg n;
    then consider x being Element of NAT such that
A2: k = x and
A3: 1 <= x and
A4: x <= n by A1;
    set x1 = k - 1, n1 = n-1;
    0 < x by A3;
    then reconsider x1 as Element of NAT by A2,NAT_1:20;
    x1 = k-1;
    hence k-1 is Element of NAT;
    0 < n by A3,A4;
    then reconsider n1 as Element of NAT by NAT_1:20;
    k+(-1) <= n+(-1) by A2,A4,XREAL_1:8;
    then x1 <= n1;
    then k-1 < n1+1 by NAT_1:13;
    hence k-1 < n;
  end;
  assume that
A5: k-1 is Element of NAT and
A6: k-1 < n;
  reconsider k1 = k-1 as Element of NAT by A5;
  0 <= k1;
  then
A7: 0 qua Nat+1 <= k-1+1 by XREAL_1:8;
  k-1+1 <= n-1+1 by A5,A6,NAT_1:13;
  hence thesis by A1,A7;

theorem Th3:
  for f being Function, x being set st x in dom f holds f*<*x*> = <*f.x*>
proof
  let f be Function;
  let x be set;
  assume
A1: x in dom f;
  then f.x in rng f by FUNCT_1:def 5;
  then reconsider D = dom f, E = rng f as non empty set by A1;
  reconsider g = f as Function of D,E by FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:11;
  rng <*x*> = {x} by FINSEQ_1:55;
  then rng <*x*> c= D by A1,ZFMISC_1:37;
  then reconsider p = <*x*> as FinSequence of D by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
  thus f*<*x*> = g*p
    .= <*f.x*> by FINSEQ_2:39;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for f, g, h being Function
  st dom f = dom g & rng f c= dom h & rng g c= dom h &
  f, g are_fiberwise_equipotent holds h*f, h*g are_fiberwise_equipotent
proof
  let f, g, h be Function such that
A1: dom f = dom g and
A2: rng f c= dom h and
A3: rng g c= dom h and
A4: f, g are_fiberwise_equipotent;

A6: dom (h*f) = dom f by A2,RELAT_1:46;
A7: dom (h*g) = dom g by A3,RELAT_1:46;
  h*f = h*g*p by A5,RELAT_1:55;
  hence thesis by A1,A6,A7,CLASSES1:88;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for fs being FinSequence of NAT holds Sum fs = 0 iff fs = (len fs) |-> 0
proof
  let fs be FinSequence of NAT;

A1: Sum fs = 0;
A2: Seg len fs = dom fs by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
A3: Seg len fs = dom ((len fs) |-> 0) by FUNCOP_1:19;

      reconsider k1=k as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 13;
      now
        assume
A5:     fs.k <> 0;
        for k being Nat st k in dom fs holds 0 <= fs.k;
        hence contradiction by A1,A2,A4,A5,RVSUM_1:115;
      end;
      hence fs.k = ((len fs) |-> 0).k by A4,FUNCOP_1:13;
    end;
    hence fs = (len fs) |-> 0 by A2,A3,FINSEQ_1:17;
