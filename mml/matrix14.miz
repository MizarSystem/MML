  reconsider z1=x1 as Element of (len x1)-tuples_on (the carrier of L) by
FINSEQ_2:110;

  mlt(x1,x2).i = (x1/.i)*(x2/.i) & (mlt(x1,x2))/.i=(x1/.i)*(x2/.i)

theorem Th6:
  for a being Element of K, x being FinSequence of K holds -a*x = (

  reconsider x1=x as Element of (n-tuples_on (the carrier of K)) by Th1;
  reconsider x0=x as Element of n-tuples_on (the carrier of K) by Th1;
  reconsider y=a*x0 as Element of (n-tuples_on (the carrier of K));

    .=(- 1_K *a)*x0 by VECTSP_1:40
