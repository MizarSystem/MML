theorem
  for A being strict Universal_Algebra holds A = 1-Alg MSAlg A
proof
  let A be strict Universal_Algebra;
  the carrier of A in {the carrier of A} by TARSKI:def 1;
  then the carrier of A in rng the Sorts of MSAlg A by FUNCOP_1:14;
  hence thesis by Def17;

theorem
  for A being Universal_Algebra for f being Function of dom signature A,
  {0}* for z being Element of {0} st f = (*-->0)*signature A holds MSSign A =
  ManySortedSign(#{0},dom signature A,f,dom signature(A)-->z#)
proof
  let A be Universal_Algebra;
  let f be Function of dom signature A, {0}*;
  let z be Element of {0};
A1: the carrier' of MSSign A = dom signature A & the Arity of MSSign A = (
  *-->0) *signature A by Def13;
