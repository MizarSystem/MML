  theorem
       for X be set holds
    x in the carrier of EqRelLatt X iff x is Equivalence_Relation of X
   proof
    let X be set;
    A1: the carrier of EqRelLatt X = { x1 where x1 is Relation of X,X :
     x1 is Equivalence_Relation of X } by MSUALG_5:def 2;
    thus x in the carrier of EqRelLatt X implies x is Equivalence_Relation of
X
    proof
     assume x in the carrier of EqRelLatt X;
     then consider x1 be Relation of X,X such that
      A2: x = x1 & x1 is Equivalence_Relation of X by A1;
     thus x is Equivalence_Relation of X by A2;
    end;
    thus x is Equivalence_Relation of X implies

    proof
     let i be set; assume i in I;
     then J.i = id (M.i) by MSUALG_3:def 1;
     hence J.i is Relation of M.i;

        for i be set, R be Relation of M.i st i in I & J.i = R holds
     R is Equivalence_Relation of M.i
    proof
     let i be set;
     let R be Relation of M.i; assume
      A1: i in I & J.i = R;
     then J.i = id (M.i) by MSUALG_3:def 1;

   proof

    proof
     let i be set; assume i in I;

     hence J.i is Relation of M.i by RELSET_1:def 1;
    end;
    then reconsider J as ManySortedRelation of M by MSUALG_4:def 2;
        for i be set, R be Relation of M.i st i in I & J.i = R holds
     R is Equivalence_Relation of M.i
    proof
     let i be set;
     let R be Relation of M.i; assume
      A1: i in I & J.i = R;
     then J.i = [:M.i,M.i:] by PRALG_2:def 9
