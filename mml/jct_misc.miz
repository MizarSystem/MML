 { F(a) where a is Element of A(): not contradiction } is non empty
proof consider a0 being set such that
A1: a0 in A() by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
      F(a0) in { F(a) where a is Element of A(): not contradiction } by A1;
 hence thesis;

theorem Th3:
 for A,B being set, f being Function st A c= dom f & f.:A c= B
  holds A c= f"B
proof let A,B be set, f being Function;
 assume A c= dom f;
  then A1: A c= f"(f.:A) by FUNCT_1:146;
 assume f.:A c= B;
  then f"(f.:A) c= f"B by RELAT_1:178;
 hence A c= f"B by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;

theorem Th4:
 for f being Function, A,B being set st A misses B
  holds f"A misses f"B
proof let f be Function, A,B be set;
 assume A misses B;
  then A /\ B = {} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  then {} = f"(A /\ B) by RELAT_1:171
     .= f"A /\ f"B by FUNCT_1:137;
 hence f"A misses f"B by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
end;

theorem Th5:
 for S,X being set, f being Function of S,X, A being Subset of X
   st X = {} implies S = {}
  holds (f"A)` = f"(A`)
proof let S,X be set, f be Function of S,X, A be Subset of X such that
A1: X = {} implies S = {};
      A misses A` by SUBSET_1:26;
then A /\ A` = {} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  then f"A /\ f"(A`) = f"({}X) by FUNCT_1:137 .= {} by RELAT_1:171;
  then A2: f"A misses f"(A`) by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
      f"A \/ f"(A`) = f"(A \/ A`) by RELAT_1:175 .= f"[#]X by SUBSET_1:25
      .= f"X by SUBSET_1:def 4 .= S by A1,FUNCT_2:48
      .= [#]S by SUBSET_1:def 4;
  then (f"A)` /\ (f"(A`))` = ([#]S)` by SUBSET_1:29
          .= {}S by SUBSET_1:21;
  then (f"A)` misses (f"(A`))` by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
 hence (f"A)` = f"(A`) by A2,SUBSET_1:46;
end;

theorem
  for S being 1-sorted, X being non empty set,
     f being Function of the carrier of S,X,
     A being Subset of X
  holds (f"A)` = f"(A`) by Th5;

 reserve i,j,m,n for Nat,
         r,s,r0,s0,t for real number;

theorem
     m <= n implies n-'(n-'m) = m
proof assume
A1: m <= n;
      n -' m <= n by JORDAN3:13;
  then n-'(n-'m) + (n-'m) = n by AMI_5:4
     .= m + (n-'m) by A1,AMI_5:4;

  holds (r + s)/2 in [.a,b.]
 proof let a,b be real number such that
A1: r in [.a,b.] and
A2: s in [.a,b.];
   reconsider a,b,r,s as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
       a <= r & a <= s by A1,A2,TOPREAL5:1;
   then a+a <= r+s by REAL_1:55;
   then (a+a)/2 <= (r+s)/2 by REAL_1:73;
then A3: a <= (r + s)/2 by XCMPLX_1:65;
       r <= b & s <= b by A1,A2,TOPREAL5:1;
   then r+s <= b+b by REAL_1:55;
   then (r+s)/2 <= (b+b)/2 by REAL_1:73;
   then (r + s)/2 <= b by XCMPLX_1:65;
  hence thesis by A3,TOPREAL5:1;

theorem Th10:
 for Nseq being increasing Seq_of_Nat, i,j st i <= j
  holds Nseq.i <= Nseq.j
proof let Nseq be increasing Seq_of_Nat;
      Nseq is non-decreasing by SEQM_3:23;
 hence thesis by SEQM_3:12;
end;

theorem Th11:
 abs(abs(r0-s0)-abs(r-s)) <= abs(r0-r) + abs(s0-s)
proof
A1: abs(abs(r0-s0) - abs(r-s)) <= abs(r0-s0 - (r-s)) by ABSVALUE:22;
      r0-s0 - (r-s) = r0-s0 - r + s by XCMPLX_1:37
      .= r0-r - s0 + s by XCMPLX_1:21
      .= r0-r - (s0-s) by XCMPLX_1:37;
  then abs(r0-s0 - (r-s)) <= abs(r0-r) + abs(s0-s) by ABSVALUE:19;
 hence abs(abs(r0-s0)-abs(r-s)) <= abs(r0-r) + abs(s0-s) by A1,AXIOMS:22;
end;

theorem
     t in ].r,s.[ implies abs(t) < max(abs(r),abs(s))
proof assume
A1: t in ].r,s.[;
  reconsider r,t,s as Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
   A2: r < t & t < s by A1,JORDAN6:45;
 per cases;
 suppose
A3: t >= 0;
  then A4: t = abs(t) by ABSVALUE:def 1;
      s > 0 by A1,A3,JORDAN6:45;
  then abs(t) < abs(s) by A2,A4,ABSVALUE:def 1;
 hence thesis by SQUARE_1:50;
 end;
 suppose
A5: t < 0;
  then A6: -t = abs(t) by ABSVALUE:def 1;
      r < 0 by A2,A5;
