    proof let k;
     assume A4:k*l>=k;
        (k + 1)*l = k * l + 1*l;
     then A5:(k+1)*l>=k+l by A4,REAL_1:55;
        k+l>=k+1 by A1,REAL_1:55;
     hence (k+1)*l>=k+1 by A5,AXIOMS:22;

       l=0 & (l+1)!>=(l+1) or l>=1 & (l+1)!>=(l+1)
     proof
      per cases by NAT_1:39;
       case l=0;
       hence thesis by NEWTON:19;
       end;
       case A6: l>=1;  (l+1)!>=(l+1)*l by A3,A4,A5,AXIOMS:25;
