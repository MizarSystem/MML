begin :: Preliminaries

reserve p, q for FinSequence,
  X, Y, x, y for set,
  D for non empty set,
  i, j, k , l, m, n, r for Element of NAT;

theorem Th1:
  for m,k,n being Nat holds m+1<=k & k<=n iff ex i being Element of
  NAT st m<=i & i<n & k=i+1
proof
  let m,k,n be Nat;
  hereby
    reconsider a19=1 as Integer;
    reconsider k9=k as Integer;
    assume that
A1: m+1<=k and
A2: k<=n;
    1<=m+1 by NAT_1:11;
    then reconsider i=k9-a19 as Element of NAT by A1,INT_1:18,XXREAL_0:2;
    take i;
    m+1-1<=k-1 by A1,XREAL_1:11;
    hence m<=i;
    k<k+1 by NAT_1:13;
    then k-1<k+1-1 by XREAL_1:11;
    hence i<n by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
    thus k=i+1;
  end;
  given i being Element of NAT such that
A3: m<=i and
A4: i<n and
A5: k=i+1;
  thus thesis by A3,A4,A5,NAT_1:13,XREAL_1:9;
end;

theorem Th2:
  q = p|Seg n implies len q<=len p & for i st 1<=i & i<=len q holds p.i = q.i
proof
  assume
A1: q = p|Seg n;
  per cases;
  suppose
A2: n<=len p;
    hence len q<=len p by A1,FINSEQ_1:21;
    let i be Element of NAT;
    assume that
A3: 1<=i and
A4: i<=len q;
    len q = n by A1,A2,FINSEQ_1:21;
    then i in Seg n by A3,A4;
    hence thesis by A1,FUNCT_1:72;
  end;
  suppose
A5: len p<=n;
    hence len q<=len p by A1,FINSEQ_2:23;
    let i be Element of NAT;
    assume that
    1<=i and
    i<=len q;
    thus thesis by A1,A5,FINSEQ_2:23;

theorem
  k+1 <= len F & ma = min_at(F, k+1, len F) & F is_split_at k & F1 = F+*
  (k+1, F.ma)+*(ma, F.(k+1)) implies F1 is_split_at k+1
proof
  assume that
A1: k+1 <= len F and
A2: ma = min_at(F, k+1, len F) and
A3: F is_split_at k and
A4: F1 = F+*(k+1, F.ma)+*(ma, F.(k+1));

  let i, j be Element of NAT;

      .= F.i by A18,FUNCT_7:34;
A20: i <= k by A18,NAT_1:13;
    thus F1.i <= F1.j

    end;

  suppose
A21: i = k+1;
A22: F1.i = F.ma
    proof

      suppose
        k+1 = ma;
        hence thesis by A4,A5,A16,A21,FUNCT_7:33;
      end;
      suppose
