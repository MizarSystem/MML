reserve n,i,j,k,l for Element of NAT;
reserve D for non empty set;
reserve c,d for Element of D;
reserve p,q,q9,r for FinSequence of D;

theorem
  len p = j+1+k implies ex q,r,c st len q = j & len r = k & p = q^<*c*>^ r
proof
  assume len p = j+1+k;
  then consider q9,r such that
A1: len q9 = j+1 and
A2: len r = k & p = q9^r by FINSEQ_2:26;
  consider q,c such that
A3: q9 = q^<*c*> by A1,FINSEQ_2:22;
  take q,r,c;
  len q9 = len q + 1 by A3,FINSEQ_2:19;
  hence thesis by A1,A2,A3;
end;

theorem
  i in Seg n implies ex j,k st n = j+1+k & i = j+1
proof
  assume
A1: i in Seg(n);
  then 1<=i by FINSEQ_1:3;
  then consider j being Nat such that
A2: i = 1+j by NAT_1:10;
  reconsider j as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 13;
  i<=n by A1,FINSEQ_1:3;
  then consider k being Nat such that
A3: n = j+1+k by A2,NAT_1:10;
  reconsider k as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 13;
  take j,k;
  thus thesis by A2,A3;
end;

theorem
  p = q^<*c*>^r & i = len q + 1 implies (for l st 1 <= l & l <= len q
holds p.l = q.l) & p.i = c & for l st i + 1 <= l & l <= len p holds p.l = r.(l-
  i)
proof
  set q9 = q^<*c*>;
  assume that
A1: p = q9^r and
A2: i = len q + 1;
A3: p = q^(<*c*>^r) by A1,FINSEQ_1:45;
  thus for l st 1 <= l & l <= len q holds p.l = q.l
  proof
    let l;
    assume 1 <= l & l <= len q;
    then l in dom q by FINSEQ_3:27;
    hence thesis by A3,FINSEQ_1:def 7;
  end;
A4: len q9 = i by A2,FINSEQ_2:19;
  i in Seg(i) by A2,FINSEQ_1:5;
  then i in dom q9 by A4,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  hence p.i = q9.i by A1,FINSEQ_1:def 7
    .= c by A2,FINSEQ_1:59;
  len p = len q9 + len r by A1,FINSEQ_1:35;
  hence thesis by A1,A4,FINSEQ_1:36;
end;

theorem Th4:
  l<=j or l=j+1 or j+2<=l
proof
A1: j+1+1 = j+2;
  l<j+1 or l = j+1 or j+1<l by XXREAL_0:1;
  hence thesis by A1,NAT_1:13;
end;

theorem
  l in Seg(n)\{i} & i=j+1 implies 1<=l & l<=j or i+1<=l & l<=n
proof
  assume that
A1: l in Seg(n)\{i} and
A2: i=j+1;
A3: i+1 = j+2 by A2;
  l in Seg(n) & l<>i by A1,ZFMISC_1:64;
  hence thesis by A2,A3,Th4,FINSEQ_1:3;
end;

definition
  let D,n;
  let p be Element of n-tuples_on D;
  let i,d;
  redefine func p+*(i,d) -> Element of n-tuples_on D;
  coherence
  proof
    dom(p+*(i,d)) = dom p by FUNCT_7:32;
    then len(p+*(i,d)) = len p by FINSEQ_3:31
      .= n by CARD_1:def 13;
    hence p+*(i,d) is Element of n-tuples_on D by FINSEQ_2:110;
  end;
end;

Lm1: for p being Element of n-tuples_on D st i in Seg n holds p+*(i,d).i = d
proof
  let p be Element of n-tuples_on D;
  Seg n = dom p by FINSEQ_2:144;
  hence thesis by FUNCT_7:33;
end;

Lm2: for p being Element of n-tuples_on D for l st l in (dom p)\{i} holds (p+*
(i,d)).l = p.l
proof
  let p being Element of n-tuples_on D;
  let l;
  assume l in (dom p)\{i};
  then not l in {i} by XBOOLE_0:def 5;
  then l <> i by TARSKI:def 1;
  hence thesis by FUNCT_7:34;

A3:     k = m9;
        thus y.k = W.(a,(p+*(m9,p.m)).k) by Def12

      suppose

theorem Th35:
  (a,x).W = p & m<=n implies (a,(x+*(m+1,x.m))).W = (p+*(m+1,p.m))
proof
  assume that
A1: (a,x).W = p and
A2: m<=n;
  W.(a,p) = x by A1,Th17;
  then W.(a,(p+*(m+1,p.m))) = (x+*(m+1,x.m)) by A2,Th34;
  hence thesis by Th17;
end;

theorem
  m<=n implies (RAS is_alternative_in m iff for x holds Phi((x+*(m+1,x.m
  ))) = 0. W )
proof
  assume
A1: m<=n;
  thus RAS is_alternative_in m implies for x holds Phi((x+*(m+1,x.m))) = 0.W
  proof
    set a =the  Point of RAS;
    assume
A2: RAS is_alternative_in m;
    let x;
    set p = (a,x).W, b = (a,(0.W)).W;
    set p9 = (p+*(m+1,p.m));
    b = a by MIDSP_2:40;
    then
A3: *'(a,p9) = b by A2,Def9;
    (a,((x+*(m+1,x.m)))).W = p9 by A1,Th35;
    hence thesis by A3,Th27;
  end;
  thus (for x holds Phi((x+*(m+1,x.m))) = 0.W) implies RAS is_alternative_in m
  proof
    assume
A4: for x holds Phi((x+*(m+1,x.m))) = 0.W;
    for a,p,pm st p.m = pm holds *'(a,p+*(m+1,pm)) = a
    proof
      let a,p,pm such that
A5:   p.m = pm;
      set x = W.(a,p), v = W.(a,a);
      set x9 = (x+*(m+1,x.m));
      v = 0.W by MIDSP_2:39;
      then
A6:   Phi(x9) = v by A4;
      W.(a,((p+*(m+1,p.m)))) = x9 by A1,Th34;
      hence thesis by A5,A6,Th26;
    end;
    hence thesis by Def9;
