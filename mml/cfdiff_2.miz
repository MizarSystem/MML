Lm1: for seq be Real_Sequence, cseq be Complex_Sequence st seq = cseq holds
seq is convergent iff cseq is convergent

proof
  deffunc F(Element of NAT) = 0;
  consider bseq being Real_Sequence such that
A1: for n holds bseq.n = F(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
  let seq be Real_Sequence, cseq be Complex_Sequence such that
A2: seq = cseq;
A3: for n holds Re (cseq.n) = seq.n & Im (cseq.n) = bseq.n
  proof
    let n;
    thus Re (cseq.n) = seq.n by A2,COMPLEX1:def 2;
    Im (cseq.n) = Im (seq.n) by A2;
    then Im (cseq.n) = 0 by COMPLEX1:def 3;
    hence Im (cseq.n) = bseq.n by A1;
  end;
  now
    let n be Nat;
    n in NAT by ORDINAL1:def 13;
    hence bseq.n = 0 by A1;
  end;
  then bseq is constant by VALUED_0:def 18;
  hence thesis by A3,COMSEQ_3:38;
end;

Lm2: for seq be Real_Sequence, cseq be Complex_Sequence, rlim be real number
st seq=cseq & seq is convergent & lim seq = rlim holds lim cseq = rlim

proof

A4: now
    let p be real number;
    assume
A5: 0 < p;
    p is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
    then consider n such that

A6: for m st n<=m holds |.cseq.m - clim.| < p by A2,A3,A5,COMSEQ_2:
    def 5;

    take n;
    thus for m st n<=m holds |.seq.m - rlim.| < p by A1,A6;
  end;
  seq is convergent by A1,A2,Lm1;
  hence lim seq = rlim by A4,SEQ_2:def 7;
end;

Lm4: for seq be Real_Sequence, cseq be Complex_Sequence st seq=cseq holds seq
is convergent_to_0 iff cseq is convergent_to_0

proof

A5: cseq is non-zero by A1,A2,FDIFF_1:def 1;
    cseq is convergent by A1,A3,Lm1;
    hence cseq is convergent_to_0 by A5,A4,CFDIFF_1:def 1;
  end;
  assume
A6: cseq is convergent_to_0;
  then lim cseq = 0 by CFDIFF_1:def 1;
  then
