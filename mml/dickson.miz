begin :: Preliminaries

theorem Th1:
  for g being Function, x being set st dom g = {x} holds g = x .--> g.x
proof
  let g be Function, x be set such that
A1: dom g = {x};
  now
    let a,b be set;
A2: dom (x .-->g.x) = {x} by FUNCOP_1:13;
    hereby
      assume
A3:   [a,b] in g;
      then
A4:   a in {x} by A1,FUNCT_1:1;
      then
A5:   a = x by TARSKI:def 1;
      then b = g.x by A3,FUNCT_1:1;
      then (x.-->g.x).a = b by A5,FUNCOP_1:72;
      hence [a,b] in x.-->g.x by A2,A4,FUNCT_1:1;
    end;
    assume
A6: [a,b] in x.-->g.x;
    then
A7: a in {x} by A2,FUNCT_1:1;
    then
A8: a = x by TARSKI:def 1;
    b = (x.-->g.x).a by A6,FUNCT_1:1
      .= g.a by A8,FUNCOP_1:72;
    hence [a,b] in g by A1,A7,FUNCT_1:1;
  end;
  hence thesis by RELAT_1:def 2;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for n being Nat holds n c= n+1
proof
  let n be Nat;
  n+1 = n \/ {n} by AFINSQ_1:2;
  hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:7;
end;

scheme FinSegRng2{m, n() -> Element of NAT, F(set)->set, P[set]}:
  {F(i) where i is Element of NAT : m()<i & i<=n() & P[i]} is finite
proof
  set F1 = {F(i) where i is Element of NAT: m()<=i & i<=n() & P[i]};
  set F2 = {F(i) where i is Element of NAT: m()< i & i<=n() & P[i]};
A1: F1 is finite from FINSEQ_1:sch 6;
  F2 c= F1
  proof
    let x be set;
    assume x in F2;
    then ex i being Element of NAT st ( F(i) = x)&( m()< i)&( i<=n())& ( P[i]);
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis by A1;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for X being infinite set ex f being Function of NAT, X st f is one-to-one
proof
  let X be infinite set;
  card NAT c= card X by CARD_1:47,CARD_3:85;
  then consider f being Function such that
A1: f is one-to-one and
A2: dom f = NAT and
A3: rng f c= X by CARD_1:10;
  now
    let x be set;
    assume x in NAT;
    then f.x in rng f by A2,FUNCT_1:3;
    hence f.x in X by A3;
  end;
  then reconsider f as Function of NAT, X by A2,FUNCT_2:3;
  take f;
  thus thesis by A1;
end;

definition
  let R be RelStr, f be sequence of R;
  attr f is ascending means
  for n being Element of NAT
  holds f.(n+1) <> f.n & [f.n, f.(n+1)] in the InternalRel of R;
end;

definition
  let R be RelStr, f be sequence of R;
  attr f is weakly-ascending means
  :Def2:
  for n being Element of NAT holds [f.n, f.(n+1)] in the InternalRel of R;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for R being non empty transitive RelStr, f being sequence of R
  st f is weakly-ascending
  holds for i,j being Element of NAT st i < j holds f.i <= f.j
proof
  let R be non empty transitive RelStr, f be sequence of R such that
A1: f is weakly-ascending;
  let i be Element of NAT;
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means i < $1 implies f.i <= f.$1;
A2: P[ 0 ] by NAT_1:2;
A3: for j being Element of NAT st P[j] holds P[j+1]
  proof
    let j be Element of NAT such that
A4: P[j] and
A5: i < j+1;
    reconsider fj1 = f.(j+1) as Element of R;
A6: [f.j, f.(j+1)] in the InternalRel of R by A1,Def2;
    then
A7: f.j <= fj1 by ORDERS_2:def 5;
A8: i <= j by A5,NAT_1:13;
    per cases by A8,XXREAL_0:1;
    suppose i < j;
      hence thesis by A4,A7,ORDERS_2:3;
    end;
    suppose i = j;
      hence thesis by A6,ORDERS_2:def 5;
    end;
  end;
  thus for j being Element of NAT holds P[j] from NAT_1:sch 1(A2,A3);
end;

theorem Th5:
  for R being non empty RelStr holds R is connected iff
  the InternalRel of R is_strongly_connected_in the carrier of R
proof
  let R be non empty RelStr;
  set IR = the InternalRel of R, CR = the carrier of R;
  hereby
    assume
A1: R is connected;
    now
      let x, y be set such that
A2:   x in CR and
A3:   y in CR;
      reconsider x9=x, y9=y as Element of R by A2,A3;
      x9 <= y9 or y9 <= x9 by A1,WAYBEL_0:def 29;
      hence [x,y] in IR or [y,x] in IR by ORDERS_2:def 5;
    end;
    hence IR is_strongly_connected_in CR by RELAT_2:def 7;
  end;
  assume
A4: IR is_strongly_connected_in CR;
  now
    let x, y be Element of R;
    [x,y] in IR or [y,x] in IR by A4,RELAT_2:def 7;
    hence x <= y or y <= x by ORDERS_2:def 5;
  end;
  hence thesis by WAYBEL_0:def 29;
end;

theorem Th7:
  for L being RelStr, Y being set, a being set
  holds (the InternalRel of L)-Seg(a) misses Y & a in Y iff
  a is_minimal_wrt Y, the InternalRel of L
proof
  let L be RelStr, Y be set, a be set;
  set IR = the InternalRel of L;
  hereby
    assume that
A1: IR-Seg(a) misses Y and
A2: a in Y;
A3: IR-Seg(a) /\ Y = {} by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
    now
      assume ex y being set st y in Y & y<>a & [y,a] in IR;
      then consider y being set such that
A4:   y in Y and
A5:   y <> a and
A6:   [y,a] in IR;
      y in IR-Seg(a) by A5,A6,WELLORD1:1;
      hence contradiction by A3,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    end;
    hence a is_minimal_wrt Y, IR by A2,WAYBEL_4:def 25;
  end;
  assume
A7: a is_minimal_wrt Y, IR;
  now
    assume not IR-Seg(a) misses Y;
    then IR-Seg(a) /\ Y <> {} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
    then consider y being set such that
A8: y in IR-Seg(a) /\ Y by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
A9: y in IR-Seg(a) by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A10: y in Y by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
A11: y <> a by A9,WELLORD1:1;
    [y,a] in IR by A9,WELLORD1:1;
    hence contradiction by A7,A10,A11,WAYBEL_4:def 25;
  end;
  hence IR-Seg(a) misses Y;
  thus thesis by A7,WAYBEL_4:def 25;
end;

theorem Th8:
  for L being non empty transitive antisymmetric RelStr,
  x being Element of L, a, N being set
  st a is_minimal_wrt (the InternalRel of L)-Seg(x) /\ N,(the InternalRel of L)
  holds a is_minimal_wrt N, (the InternalRel of L)
proof
  let L be non empty transitive antisymmetric RelStr,
  x be Element of L, a,N be set such that
  A1: a
 is_minimal_wrt (the InternalRel of L)-Seg(x) /\ N,(the InternalRel of L);
  set IR = the InternalRel of L, CR = the carrier of L;
A2: IR is_transitive_in CR by ORDERS_2:def 3;
  now

    then

    then
A5: a <> x by WELLORD1:1;
A6: [a,x] in IR by A4,WELLORD1:1;
    then reconsider a9 = a as Element of L by ZFMISC_1:87;

    now
