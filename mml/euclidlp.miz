:: Preliminaries

theorem Th1:
  (s/t)*(u*x)=(s*u)/t*x & (1/t)*(u*x)= u/t*x
proof
  thus (s/t)*(u*x) = ((s/t)*u)*x by EUCLID_4:4
    .= (s*u)/t*x by XCMPLX_1:75;
  thus (1/t)*(u*x) = ((1/t)*u)*x by EUCLID_4:4
    .= u/t*x by XCMPLX_1:100;
end;

canceled 5;

theorem Th7:
  x - x = 0*n & x + -x = 0*n
proof
  thus x - x = 0*n by RVSUM_1:58;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th8:
  -a*x = (-a)*x & -a*x = a*(-x)
proof
  thus -a*x = ((-1)*a)*x by EUCLID_4:4
    .= (-a)*x;
  hence -a*x = (a*(-1))*x .= a*(-x) by EUCLID_4:4;
end;

theorem Th9:
  x1 - (x2 - x3) = x1 - x2 + x3
proof
  thus x1 - (x2 - x3) = x1 - x2 - -x3 by RVSUM_1:60
    .= x1 - x2 + x3;
end;

theorem Th10:
  x1 + (x2 - x3) = x1 + x2 - x3
proof
  thus x1 + (x2 - x3) = x1 + x2 + -x3 by RVSUM_1:32
    .= x1 + x2 - x3;
end;

theorem Th11:
  x1 = x2 + x3 iff x2 = x1 - x3
proof
  thus x1 = x2 + x3 implies x2 = x1 - x3
  proof
    assume x1 = x2 + x3;
    hence x1 - x3 = x2 + (x3 + -x3) by RVSUM_1:32
      .= x2 + 0*n by Th7
      .= x2 by EUCLID_4:1;
  end;
  now
    assume x2 = x1 - x3;
    hence x2 + x3 = x1 + (-x3 + x3) by RVSUM_1:32
      .= x1 + 0*n by Th7
      .= x1 by EUCLID_4:1;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th12:
  x=x1+x2+x3 iff x-x1=x2+x3
proof
  thus x=x1+x2+x3 implies x-x1=x2+x3
  proof
    assume x=x1+x2+x3;
    then x = x1 + (x2 + x3) by RVSUM_1:32;
    hence thesis by Th11;
  end;
  now
    assume x-x1=x2+x3;
    hence x = x1 + (x2 + x3) by Th11
      .= x1 + x2 + x3 by RVSUM_1:32;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th13:
  -(x1 + x2 + x3) = -x1 + -x2 + -x3
proof
  thus -(x1+x2+x3) = 0*n -(x1+x2+x3) by RVSUM_1:54
    .= 0*n - (x1+x2) - x3 by RVSUM_1:60
    .= 0*n - x1 - x2 - x3 by RVSUM_1:60
    .= -x1 + -x2 + -x3 by RVSUM_1:54;
end;

Lm1: x1<>x2 implies |.x1-x2.|<>0
proof
  now
    assume that
A1: x1<>x2 and
A2: not |.x1-x2.| <> 0;
    |(x1-x2,x1-x2)| = 0 by A2,EUCLID_4:21;
    then x1 - x2 = 0*n by EUCLID_4:22;
    then x1 = x2 + 0*n by Th11
      .= x2 by EUCLID_4:1;
    hence contradiction by A1;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th14:
  x1=x2 iff x1-x2=0*n
proof
  thus x1 = x2 implies x1 - x2 = 0*n by Th7;
  assume x1 - x2 = 0*n;
  hence x1 = x2 + 0*n by Th11
    .= x2 by EUCLID_4:1;
end;

theorem Th15:
  x1 - x0 = t*x & x1 <> x0 implies t <> 0
proof
  assume that
A1: x1 - x0 = t*x and
A2: x1 <> x0;
  assume not t <> 0;
  then x1 - x0 = 0*n by A1,EUCLID_4:3;
  hence contradiction by A2,Th14;
end;

theorem Th16:
  (a - b)*x = a*x + (-b)*x & (a - b)*x = a*x + -b*x & (a - b)*x = a*x - b*x
proof
  thus
A1: (a - b)*x = (a + -b)*x .= a*x + (-b)*x by EUCLID_4:7;
  hence (a - b)*x = a*x + -b*x by Th8;
  thus thesis by A1,Th8;
end;

theorem Th17:
  a*(x - y) = a*x + -a*y & a*(x - y) = a*x + (-a)*y & a*(x - y) = a*x - a*y
proof
  thus
A1: a*(x - y) = a*x + a*(-y) by EUCLID_4:6
    .= a*x + -a*y by Th8;
  hence a*(x - y) = a*x + (-a)*y by Th8;
  thus thesis by A1;
end;

theorem Th18:
  (s - t - u)*x = s*x - t*x - u*x
proof
  thus (s - t - u)*x = (s - t)*x - u*x by Th16
    .= s*x - t*x - u*x by Th16;
end;

theorem Th19:
  x - (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3) = x + ((-a1)*x1 + (-a2)*x2 + (-a3)*x3)
proof
  thus x - (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3) = x + (-a1*x1 + -a2*x2 + -a3*x3) by Th13
    .= x + ((-a1)*x1 + -a2*x2 + -a3*x3) by Th8
    .= x + ((-a1)*x1 + (-a2)*x2 + -a3*x3) by Th8
    .= x + ((-a1)*x1 + (-a2)*x2 + (-a3)*x3) by Th8;
end;

theorem
  x - (s+t+u)*y = x + (-s)*y + (-t)*y + (-u)*y
proof
  thus x - (s+t+u)*y = x - ((s+t)*y + u*y) by EUCLID_4:7
    .= x - (s*y + t*y + u*y) by EUCLID_4:7
    .= x + ((-s)*y + (-t)*y + (-u)*y) by Th19
    .= x + ((-s)*y + (-t)*y) + (-u)*y by RVSUM_1:32
    .= x + (-s)*y + (-t)*y + (-u)*y by RVSUM_1:32;
end;

theorem Th21:
  (x1+x2)+(y1+y2)=(x1+y1)+(x2+y2)
proof
  thus (x1+x2)+(y1+y2) = (x1+x2)+y1+y2 by RVSUM_1:32
    .= (x1+y1)+x2+y2 by RVSUM_1:32
    .= (x1+y1)+(x2+y2) by RVSUM_1:32;
end;

theorem Th22:
  (x1+x2+x3)+(y1+y2+y3)=(x1+y1)+(x2+y2)+(x3+y3)
proof
  thus (x1+x2+x3)+(y1+y2+y3) = ((x1+x2)+(y1+y2))+(x3+y3) by Th21
    .= (x1+y1)+(x2+y2)+(x3+y3) by Th21;
end;

theorem Th23:
  (x1+x2)-(y1+y2)=(x1-y1)+(x2-y2)
proof
  thus (x1+x2)-(y1+y2) = (x1 + x2) - y1 - y2 by RVSUM_1:60
    .= (x1 + x2) + (-y1+ -y2) by RVSUM_1:32
    .= (x1 - y1) + (x2 - y2) by Th21;
end;

theorem
  (x1+x2+x3)-(y1+y2+y3)=(x1-y1)+(x2-y2)+(x3-y3)
proof
  thus (x1+x2+x3)-(y1+y2+y3) = ((x1+x2) - (y1+y2))+ (x3 - y3) by Th23
    .= (x1 - y1) + (x2 - y2) + (x3 - y3) by Th23;
end;

theorem Th25:
  a*(x1+x2+x3)=a*x1+a*x2+a*x3
proof
  thus a*(x1+x2+x3) = a*(x1+x2)+a*x3 by EUCLID_4:6
    .= a*x1+a*x2+a*x3 by EUCLID_4:6;
end;

theorem Th26:
  a*(b1*x1+b2*x2) = (a*b1)*x1+(a*b2)*x2
proof
  thus a*(b1*x1+b2*x2) = a*(b1*x1)+a*(b2*x2) by EUCLID_4:6
    .= (a*b1)*x1+a*(b2*x2) by EUCLID_4:4
    .= (a*b1)*x1+(a*b2)*x2 by EUCLID_4:4;
end;

theorem Th27:
  a*(b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3) = (a*b1)*x1+(a*b2)*x2+(a*b3)*x3
proof
  thus a*(b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3) = a*(b1*x1)+a*(b2*x2)+a*(b3*x3) by Th25
    .= (a*b1)*x1+a*(b2*x2)+a*(b3*x3) by EUCLID_4:4
    .= (a*b1)*x1+(a*b2)*x2+a*(b3*x3) by EUCLID_4:4
    .= (a*b1)*x1+(a*b2)*x2+(a*b3)*x3 by EUCLID_4:4;
end;

theorem Th28:
  (a1*x1+a2*x2)+(b1*x1+b2*x2)=(a1+b1)*x1+(a2+b2)*x2
proof
  thus (a1*x1+a2*x2)+(b1*x1+b2*x2) = (a1*x1+b1*x1)+(a2*x2+b2*x2) by Th21
    .= (a1+b1)*x1+(a2*x2+b2*x2) by EUCLID_4:7
    .= (a1+b1)*x1+(a2+b2)*x2 by EUCLID_4:7;
end;

theorem Th29:
  (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3)+(b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3)=(a1+b1)*x1+(a2+b2)*x2+( a3+b3)*x3
proof
  thus (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3)+(b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3) = ((a1*x1+a2*x2)+(b1*x1+b2*x2))
  +(a3*x3+b3*x3) by Th21
    .= (a1+b1)*x1+(a2+b2)*x2+(a3*x3+b3*x3) by Th28
    .= (a1+b1)*x1+(a2+b2)*x2+(a3+b3)*x3 by EUCLID_4:7;
end;

theorem Th30:
  (a1*x1+a2*x2)-(b1*x1+b2*x2)=(a1-b1)*x1+(a2-b2)*x2
proof
  thus (a1*x1+a2*x2)-(b1*x1+b2*x2) = (a1*x1-b1*x1)+(a2*x2-b2*x2) by Th23
    .= (a1-b1)*x1+(a2*x2-b2*x2) by Th16
    .= (a1-b1)*x1+(a2-b2)*x2 by Th16;
end;

theorem Th31:
  (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3)-(b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3)=(a1-b1)*x1+(a2-b2)*x2+( a3-b3)*x3
proof
  thus (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3)-(b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3) = ((a1*x1+a2*x2)-(b1*x1+b2*x2))

end;

theorem Th32:
  a1+a2+a3=1 implies a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3=x1+a2*(x2-x1)+a3*(x3-x1)
proof
  assume a1+a2+a3=1;
  then a1=1-a2-a3;
  hence a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3 = 1 * x1 - a2*x1 - a3*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 by Th18
    .= x1 + -a2*x1 - a3*x1 + a2*x2 + a3*x3 by EUCLID_4:3
