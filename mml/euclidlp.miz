:: Preliminaries

theorem LM001:
  (s/t)*(u*x)=(s*u)/t*x & (1/t)*(u*x)= u/t*x
proof
  thus (s/t)*(u*x) = ((s/t)*u)*x by EUCLID_4:4
                  .= (s*u)/t*x by XCMPLX_1:75;
  thus (1/t)*(u*x) = ((1/t)*u)*x by EUCLID_4:4
                  .= u/t*x by XCMPLX_1:100;
end;

theorem LM002:
  x1 + (x2 + x3) = (x1 + x2) + x3
proof
  reconsider x1' = x1, x2' = x2, x3' = x3 as Element of n-tuples_on REAL
    by EUCLID:def 1;
  thus x1 + (x2 + x3) = (x1' + x2') + x3' by RVSUM_1:32
                     .= (x1 + x2) + x3;
end;

theorem LM059:
  x - 0*n = x
proof
  reconsider x' = x as Element of n-tuples_on REAL by EUCLID:def 1;
  0.REAL n = 0*n & 0*n = n|->(0 qua Real) by EUCLID:def 4,def 9;
  hence x - 0*n = x' by RVSUM_1:53
              .= x;
end;

theorem LM004:
  0*n - x = -x
proof
  reconsider x' = x as Element of n-tuples_on REAL by EUCLID:def 1;
  0.REAL n = 0*n & 0*n = n|->(0 qua Real) by EUCLID:def 4,def 9;
  hence 0*n - x = -x' by RVSUM_1:54
               .= -x;
end;

theorem LM005:
  x1 - (x2 + x3) = x1 - x2 - x3
proof
  reconsider x1' = x1, x2' = x2, x3' = x3 as Element of n-tuples_on REAL
    by EUCLID:def 1;
  thus x1 - (x2 + x3) = x1' - x2' - x3' by RVSUM_1:60
                     .= x1 - x2 - x3;
end;

theorem LM007:
  x1 - x2 = x1 + -x2
proof
  reconsider x1'= x1, x2' = x2 as Element of n-tuples_on REAL by EUCLID:def 1;
  thus x1 - x2 = x1' + -x2' by RVSUM_1:52
              .= x1 + -x2;
end;

theorem LM008:
  x - x = 0*n & x + -x = 0*n
proof
  reconsider x' = x as Element of n-tuples_on REAL by EUCLID:def 1;
  thus A1:x - x = x' - x'
               .=(n|->0) by RVSUM_1:58
               .= 0*n by EUCLID:def 4;
  thus x + -x = 0*n by A1,LM007;
end;

LM065: (-1)*x = -x
proof
  thus -x = 0*n - x by LM004
         .= 0 * x - x by EUCLID_4:3
         .= (-1 + 1)*x + -x by LM007
         .= (-1)*x + 1 * x + -x by EUCLID_4:7
         .= (-1)*x + x + -x by EUCLID_4:3
         .= (-1)*x + (x + -x) by LM002
         .= (-1)*x + 0*n by LM008
         .= (-1)*x by EUCLID_4:1;
end;

theorem LM006:
  -a*x = (-a)*x & -a*x = a*(-x)
proof
  reconsider p1 = a*x as Point of TOP-REAL n by EUCLID:25;
  thus -a*x = -p1 by EUCLID:def 12
           .= (-1)*p1 by EUCLID:43
           .= (-1)*(a*x) by EUCLID:def 11
           .= ((-1)*a)*x by EUCLID_4:4
           .= (-a)*x;
  hence -a*x = (a*(-1))*x
            .= a*((-1)*x) by EUCLID_4:4
            .= a*(-x) by LM065;
end;

theorem LM058:
  x1 - (x2 - x3) = x1 - x2 + x3
proof
  thus x1 - (x2 - x3) = x1 - (x2 + -x3) by LM007
                     .= x1 - x2 - -x3 by LM005
                     .= x1 - x2 + --x3 by LM007
                     .= x1 - x2 + x3;
end;

theorem LM060:
  x1 + (x2 - x3) = x1 + x2 - x3
proof
  thus x1 + (x2 - x3) = x1 + (x2 + -x3) by LM007
                     .= x1 + x2 + -x3 by LM002
                     .= x1 + x2 - x3 by LM007;
end;

theorem LM028:
  x1 = x2 + x3 iff x2 = x1 - x3
proof
  thus x1 = x2 + x3 implies x2 = x1 - x3
  proof
    assume A1:x1 = x2 + x3;
    thus x1 - x3 = (x2 + x3) + -x3 by LM007,A1
                .= x2 + (x3 + -x3) by LM002
                .= x2 + 0*n by LM008
                .= x2 by EUCLID_4:1;
  end;
  now assume A2:x2 = x1 - x3;
    thus x2 + x3 = x1 + -x3 + x3 by LM007,A2
                .= x1 + (-x3 + x3) by LM002
                .= x1 + 0*n by LM008
                .= x1 by EUCLID_4:1;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem LM025:
  x=x1+x2+x3 iff x-x1=x2+x3
proof
  thus x=x1+x2+x3 implies x-x1=x2+x3
  proof
    assume x=x1+x2+x3;
    then x = x1 + (x2 + x3) by LM002;
    hence x - x1 = x2 + x3 by LM028;
  end;
  now assume x-x1=x2+x3;
    hence x = x1 + (x2 + x3) by LM028
           .= x1 + x2 + x3 by LM002;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem LM019:
  -(x1 + x2 + x3) = -x1 + -x2 + -x3
proof
  thus -(x1+x2+x3) = 0*n -(x1+x2+x3) by LM004
            .= 0*n - (x1+x2) - x3 by LM005
            .= 0*n - x1 - x2 - x3 by LM005
            .= -x1 - x2 - x3 by LM004
            .= -x1 + -x2 - x3 by LM007
            .= -x1 + -x2 + -x3 by LM007;
end;

LM009:x1<>x2 implies |.x1-x2.|<>0
proof
  now assume A1: x1<>x2 & not |.x1-x2.| <> 0;
    then |(x1-x2,x1-x2)| = 0 by EUCLID_4:21;
    then x1 - x2 = 0*n by EUCLID_4:22;
    then x1 = x2 + 0*n by LM028
           .= x2 by EUCLID_4:1;
    hence contradiction by A1;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem LM032:
  x1=x2 iff x1-x2=0*n
proof
  thus x1 = x2 implies x1 - x2 = 0*n by LM008;
  assume A2:x1 - x2 = 0*n;
  thus x1 = x2 + 0*n by A2,LM028
         .= x2 by EUCLID_4:1;
end;

theorem LM045:
  x1 - x0 = t*x & x1 <> x0 implies t <> 0
proof
  assume A1:x1 - x0 = t*x & x1 <> x0;
  assume not t <> 0;
  then x1 - x0 = 0*n by A1,EUCLID_4:3;
  hence contradiction by LM032,A1;
end;

theorem LM018:
  (a - b)*x = a*x + (-b)*x & (a - b)*x = a*x + -b*x & (a - b)*x = a*x - b*x
proof
  thus (a - b)*x = (a + -b)*x
                .= a*x + (-b)*x by EUCLID_4:7;
  hence (a - b)*x = a*x + -b*x by LM006;
  hence thesis by LM007;
end;

theorem LM027:
  a*(x - y) = a*x + -a*y & a*(x - y) = a*x + (-a)*y & a*(x - y) = a*x - a*y
proof
  thus A1:a*(x - y) = a*(x + -y) by LM007
                   .= a*x + a*(-y) by EUCLID_4:6
                   .= a*x + -a*y by LM006;
  hence a*(x - y) = a*x + (-a)*y by LM006;
  thus thesis by A1,LM007;
end;

theorem LM010:
  (s - t - u)*x = s*x - t*x - u*x
proof
  thus (s - t - u)*x = (s - t)*x - u*x by LM018
                    .= s*x - t*x - u*x by LM018;
end;

theorem LM020:
  x - (a1*x1+a2*x2+a3*x3) = x + ((-a1)*x1 + (-a2)*x2 + (-a3)*x3)
proof

           .= x + (-a1*x1 + -a2*x2 + -a3*x3) by LM019

           .= x + ((-a1)*x1 + (-a2)*x2 + (-a3)*x3) by LM006;
end;

theorem
  x - (s+t+u)*y = x + (-s)*y + (-t)*y + (-u)*y
proof

end;

theorem LM021:
  (x1+x2+x3)+(y1+y2+y3)=(x1+y1)+(x2+y2)+(x3+y3)
