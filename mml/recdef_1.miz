        D for non empty set,
        Z,x,y,z,y1,y2 for set,
        p,q for FinSequence;

Lm1: for p being FinSequence of D st 1 <= n & n <= len p holds
            p.n is Element of D
  proof let p be FinSequence of D;
    assume 1 <= n & n <= len p;
    then n in Seg len p by FINSEQ_1:3;
    then n in dom p by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
    then A1: p.n in rng p by FUNCT_1:def 5;
       rng p c= D by FINSEQ_1:def 4;
   hence p.n is Element of D by A1;
  end;

 redefine func p.n -> Nat;

    proof
      per cases;
      suppose n in dom p;
      hence p.n is Nat by PARTFUN1:27;
