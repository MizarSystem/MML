theorem Th2:
  for A being Subset of REAL holds for x being Real st x <> 0 holds
  x" ** (x ** A) = A
proof
  let A be Subset of REAL;
  let x be Real;
  assume
A1: x <> 0;
  thus x" ** (x ** A) c= A
  proof
    let y be set;
    assume
A2: y in x" ** (x ** A);
    then reconsider y as Real;
    consider z being Real such that
A3: z in x ** A and
A4: y = x" * z by A2,INTEGRA2:def 2;
    consider t being Real such that
A5: t in A and
A6: z = x * t by A3,INTEGRA2:def 2;
    y = (x" * x) * t by A4,A6
      .= 1 * t by A1,XCMPLX_0:def 7
      .= t;
    hence thesis by A5;
  end;
  let y be set;
  assume
A7: y in A;
  then reconsider y as Real;
  set t = y / x";
A8: t in x ** A by A7,INTEGRA2:def 2;
  y = x" * t by A1,XCMPLX_1:88,203;

end;

theorem Th3:
  for x being Real st x <> 0 holds for A being Subset of REAL holds
  A = REAL implies x ** A = A
proof
  let x be Real;

  assume
A2: A = REAL;
  for y being set st y in A holds y in x ** A
  proof

    reconsider z = y/x as Real;
    y = x * z by A1,XCMPLX_1:88;

    reconsider t as Element of A by A3;
    reconsider t as Real by A3;

  end;
  0 ** A c= {0}
  proof
    let y be set;
    assume
A4: y in 0 ** A;
    then reconsider y as Real;
    ex z being Real st z in A & y = 0 * z by A4,INTEGRA2:def 2;

theorem Th5:
  for x being Real holds x ** {} = {}
proof
  let x be Real;
  x ** {} c= {}
  proof
    let y be set;
    assume
A1: y in x ** {};
    then reconsider y as Real;
    ex z being Real st z in {} & y = x * z by A1,INTEGRA2:def 2;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis;

theorem Th6:
  for a,b being R_eal st a <= b holds a = -infty & b = -infty or a
  = -infty & b in REAL or a = -infty & b = +infty or a in REAL & b in REAL or a
  in REAL & b = +infty or a = +infty & b = +infty
proof
  let a,b be R_eal;
  a in REAL or a in {-infty,+infty} by XBOOLE_0:def 3,XXREAL_0:def 4;
  then
A1: a in REAL or a = -infty or a = +infty by TARSKI:def 2;
  b in REAL or b in {-infty,+infty} by XBOOLE_0:def 3,XXREAL_0:def 4;
