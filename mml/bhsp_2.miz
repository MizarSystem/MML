theorem Th1:
  seq is constant implies seq is convergent
proof
     assume seq is constant;
     then consider x such that

theorem Th2:
  seq is convergent & (ex k st for n st k <= n holds seq'.n = seq.n)

  then A10:  dist((seq1.n) , g1) + dist((seq2.n) , g2) < r by XCMPLX_1:66;
        dist((seq1 + seq2).n , g) =
      dist((seq1.n) + (seq2.n) , (g1 + g2)) by NORMSP_1:def 5;
      then dist((seq1 + seq2).n , g) <= dist((seq1.n) , g1) +
      dist((seq2.n) , g2) by BHSP_1:47;

theorem Th7:
  seq is convergent implies seq + x is convergent
proof
     assume seq is convergent;

end;

theorem Th8:
  seq is convergent implies seq - x is convergent
proof
     assume seq is convergent;
     then seq + (-x) is convergent by Th7;
