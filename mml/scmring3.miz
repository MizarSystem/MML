definition
 cluster INT -> infinite;
coherence by FINSET_1:13,INT_1:14;
end;

definition
 cluster INT.Ring -> infinite good;
coherence
  proof
    thus the carrier of INT.Ring is infinite by INT_3:def 3;
    thus the carrier of INT.Ring <> SCM-Instr-Loc by AMI_2:6,INT_3:def 3;
    assume the carrier of INT.Ring = SCM-Instr INT.Ring;
    then 1 in SCM-Instr INT.Ring by INT_1:12,INT_3:def 3;
    then ex a, b being set st a in Segm 8 &
     b in (union {the carrier of INT.Ring} \/ NAT)* & 1 = [a,b]
      by ZFMISC_1:def 2;
    hence thesis by AMI_1:2;
  end;
end;

definition
 cluster strict infinite 1-sorted;
existence
  proof
    take A = 1-sorted(#INT#);
    thus A is strict & the carrier of A is infinite;
  end;
end;

definition
 cluster strict infinite good Ring;
existence
  proof
    take INT.Ring;
    thus thesis;
  end;
end;

theorem Th1:
 ObjectKind a = the carrier of R
  proof
A1: a in SCM-Data-Loc by SCMRING2:1;
A2: the Object-Kind of SCM R = SCM-OK R by SCMRING2:def 1;
    thus ObjectKind a = (the Object-Kind of SCM R).a by AMI_1:def 6
        .= the carrier of R by A1,A2,SCMRING1:5;
  end;

definition
 let R be good Ring;
 let la, lb be Data-Location of R;
 let a, b be Element of R;
 redefine func (la,lb) --> (a,b) -> FinPartState of SCM R;
coherence
  proof
    reconsider a' = a as Element of ObjectKind la by Th1;
    reconsider b' = b as Element of ObjectKind lb by Th1;
      (la,lb) --> (a',b') is FinPartState of SCM R;

theorem Th2:
 not a in the Instruction-Locations of SCM R
  proof
      a in (the carrier of SCM R) \ (SCM-Instr-Loc \/
 {0}) by SCMRING2:def 2;
    then not a in SCM-Instr-Loc \/ {0} by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then not a in SCM-Instr-Loc by XBOOLE_0:def 2;
    hence thesis by SCMRING2:def 1;
  end;

theorem Th3:
 a <> IC SCM R
  proof
      a in (the carrier of SCM R) \ (SCM-Instr-Loc \/
 {0}) by SCMRING2:def 2;
    then not a in SCM-Instr-Loc \/ {0} by XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then not a in {0} by XBOOLE_0:def 2;
    then a <> 0 by TARSKI:def 1;
    hence thesis by SCMRING2:9;
  end;

theorem Th4:
 SCM-Data-Loc <> the Instruction-Locations of SCM R
  proof
    assume
A1:   not thesis;
A2: the Instruction-Locations of SCM R = SCM-Instr-Loc by SCMRING2:def 1;
    consider a being Element of SCM-Instr-Loc;
      a in SCM-Instr-Loc;
    hence thesis by A1,A2,AMI_2:12;
  end;

theorem Th5:
 for o being Object of SCM R holds
  o = IC SCM R or o in the Instruction-Locations of SCM R or
  o is Data-Location of R
  proof
     let o be Object of SCM R;
     assume o <> IC SCM R;
     then not o in {IC SCM R} by TARSKI:def 1;
then A1:  not o in {0} by SCMRING2:9;
     assume not o in the Instruction-Locations of SCM R;
     then not o in SCM-Instr-Loc by SCMRING2:def 1;
     then not o in SCM-Instr-Loc \/ {0} by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 2;
     hence o in (the carrier of SCM R) \ (SCM-Instr-Loc \/ {0}) by XBOOLE_0:def
4;
  end;

theorem Th6:
 i1 <> i2 implies Next i1 <> Next i2
  proof

    consider m1 being Element of SCM-Instr-Loc such that
A2:   m1 = i1 & Next i1 = Next m1 by SCMRING2:def 10;
    consider m2 being Element of SCM-Instr-Loc such that
A3:   m2 = i2 & Next i2 = Next m2 by SCMRING2:def 10;

then A6: a in dom s2 /\ (dom s2 \ IL) by A3,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    thus s1.a = (s1|(dom s1 \ IL)).a by A5,FUNCT_1:71
             .= (s2|(dom s2 \ IL)).a by A1,FUNCT_7:def 2
