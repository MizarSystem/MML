    proof
     assume x<=y;
      then x<y or x=y by ORDERS_2:def 10;
     hence thesis by A1,Th3;
    end;
     height(x) <= height(y) implies x<=y
    proof
     assume height(x) <= height(y);
      then height(x) < height(y) or height(x) = height(y) by REAL_1:def 5;
      then x<y or height(x) = height(y) by A1,Th3;
