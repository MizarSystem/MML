theorem Th1:
for A,B being FinSequence, f being Function
 st rng A \/ rng B c= dom f
  ex fA, fB being FinSequence st fA = f*A & fB = f*B & f*(A^B) = fA^fB
proof let A,B being FinSequence, f being Function; assume
A1: rng A \/ rng B c= dom f;
        rng A c= rng A \/ rng B by XBOOLE_1:7;
then A2: rng A c= dom f by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
   then reconsider fA = f*A as FinSequence by FINSEQ_1:20;
A3: dom (f*A) = dom A by A2,RELAT_1:46;
then A4: len fA = len A by FINSEQ_3:31;    rng B c= rng A \/ rng B by
XBOOLE_1:7
;
then A5: rng B c= dom f by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
   then reconsider fB = f*B as FinSequence by FINSEQ_1:20;
A6: dom (f*B) = dom B by A5,RELAT_1:46;
then A7: len fB = len B by FINSEQ_3:31;
A8: rng (A^B) c= dom f by A1,FINSEQ_1:44;
   then reconsider fAB = f*(A^B) as FinSequence by FINSEQ_1:20;
A9: dom (f*(A^B)) = dom (A^B) by A8,RELAT_1:46;
then A10: len fAB = len (A^B) by FINSEQ_3:31 .= len fA + len fB by A4,A7,
FINSEQ_1:35
          .= len (fA^fB) by FINSEQ_1:35;
   take fA, fB;
        now let k be Nat; assume 1 <=k & k <= len fAB;
   then A11: k in dom fAB by FINSEQ_3:27;
       per cases; suppose A12: k in dom fA;
       hence (fA^fB).k = fA.k by FINSEQ_1:def 7
          .= f.(A.k) by A12,FUNCT_1:22 .= f.((A^B).k) by A3,A12,FINSEQ_1:def 7
          .= fAB.k by A11,FUNCT_1:22;
       end;
       suppose not k in dom fA; then consider n being Nat such that
   A13: n in dom B & k=len A + n by A3,A9,A11,FINSEQ_1:38;
       thus fAB.k = f.((A^B).k) by A11,FUNCT_1:22
         .= f.(B.n) by A13,FINSEQ_1:def 7 .= fB.n by A6,A13,FUNCT_1:22

   end;
   hence thesis by A10,FINSEQ_1:18;

theorem Th2:
for b being bag of 0 holds decomp b = <* <* {}, {} *> *>
proof let b be bag of 0;    b in Bags {} by POLYNOM1:def 14;
then A1: b = {} by POLYNOM1:55,TARSKI:def 1;
        A2: EmptyBag {} = {} --> 0 by POLYNOM1:def 15;
    then divisors b = <* {} *> by A1,POLYNOM1:71;
then A3: len divisors b = 1 by FINSEQ_1:56;
    A4: dom divisors b = dom decomp b by POLYNOM1:def 19;
then A5: len decomp b = 1 by A3,FINSEQ_3:31;
         1 in dom decomp b by A3,A4,FINSEQ_3:27;
    then (decomp b).1=(decomp b)/.1 by PARTFUN1:def 8.=<* {},{}
*>by A1,A2,POLYNOM1:75;
    hence decomp b = <* <* {}, {} *> *> by A5,FINSEQ_1:57;

theorem Th3:
for i,j being Element of NAT, b being bag of j st i <= j
 holds (b|i) is Element of Bags i
proof let i,j being Element of NAT, b being bag of j; assume
A1: i <= j;
A2: rng b c= NAT by VALUED_0:def 6;    rng (b|i) c= rng b by RELAT_1:99;
     then rng (b|i) c= NAT by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
then A3: (b|i) is natural-yielding by VALUED_0:def 6;
          i c= j proof let x be set; assume
               x in i; then x in {y where y is Element of NAT : y < i }
               by AXIOMS:30;
          then consider x' being Element of NAT such that
     A4: x'=x & x' < i;
               x' < j by A1,A4,XXREAL_0:2;
               then x' in {y where y is Element of NAT : y < j
};
          hence x in j by A4,AXIOMS:30;
     end; then i c= dom b by PBOOLE:def 3; then dom (b|i)=i by RELAT_1:91;
     then (b|i) is ManySortedSet of i by PBOOLE:def 3;
 hence (b|i) is Element of Bags i by A3,POLYNOM1:def 14;
end;

theorem Th4:
for i, j being set, b1, b2 being bag of j, b1',b2' being bag of i
 st b1' = (b1|i) & b2' = (b2|i) & b1 divides b2 holds b1' divides b2'
proof let i,j be set, b1,b2 be bag of j, b1',b2' be bag of i; assume
A1: b1'=(b1|i) & b2'=(b2|i) & b1 divides b2;
          now let k be set;
     A2: dom b1' = i by PBOOLE:def 3 .= dom b2' by PBOOLE:def 3;
          per cases; suppose
     A3: not k in dom b1';
          then b1'.k = {} by FUNCT_1:def 4 .= b2'.k by A2,A3,FUNCT_1:def 4;
          hence b1'.k <= b2'.k;
          end;
          suppose
     A4: k in dom b1';
     then A5: b1'.k = b1.k by A1,FUNCT_1:70;
          b2'.k = b2.k by A1,A2,A4,FUNCT_1:70;
          hence b1'.k <= b2'.k by A1,A5,POLYNOM1:def 13;
     end;
     end;
     hence b1' divides b2' by POLYNOM1:def 13;
end;

theorem Th5:
for i,j be set, b1, b2 being bag of j, b1', b2' being bag of i
 st b1'=(b1|i) & b2'=(b2|i) holds (b1-' b2)|i = b1'-' b2' & (b1+b2)|i = b1'+b2'
proof let i,j be set, b1, b2 being bag of j, b1', b2' being bag of i; assume
A1: b1'=(b1|i) & b2'=(b2|i);    dom (b1 -' b2) = j by PBOOLE:def 3;
then A2: dom ((b1 -' b2)|i) = j /\ i by RELAT_1:90;    dom b1 = j by

A5: dom (b1' -' b2') = i by PBOOLE:def 3 .= j /\ i by A1,A3,PBOOLE:def 3;
          now let x be set; assume
     A6: x in j /\ i;
      hence ((b1 -' b2)|i).x = (b1 -' b2).x by A2,FUNCT_1:70
        .= b1.x -' b2.x by POLYNOM1:def 6
        .= b1'.x -' b2.x by A1,A3,A6,FUNCT_1:70

        .= (b1' -' b2').x by POLYNOM1:def 6;
     end;
     hence (b1 -' b2)|i = b1' -' b2' by A2,A5,FUNCT_1:9;
          dom (b1 + b2) = j by PBOOLE:def 3;
then A7: dom ((b1 + b2)|i) = j /\ i by RELAT_1:90;
A8: dom (b1' + b2') = i by PBOOLE:def 3 .= j /\ i by A1,A3,PBOOLE:def 3;
          now let x be set; assume
     A9: x in j /\ i;
      hence ((b1 + b2)|i).x = (b1 + b2).x by A7,FUNCT_1:70
                               .= b1.x + b2.x by POLYNOM1:def 5
                               .= b1'.x + b2.x by A1,A3,A9,FUNCT_1:70
                               .= b1'.x + b2'.x by A1,A4,A9,FUNCT_1:70
                               .= (b1' + b2').x by POLYNOM1:def 5;
     end;
     hence (b1 + b2)|i = b1'+b2' by A7,A8,FUNCT_1:9;
end;
