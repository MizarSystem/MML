reserve T for TopSpace;

theorem Th1:
  for A,B being Subset of T holds A \/ B = [#] T iff A` c= B
proof
  let A,B be Subset of T;
A1: now
    assume A` c= B;
    then A \/ A` c= A \/ B by XBOOLE_1:9;
    then [#] T c= A \/ B by PRE_TOPC:2;

  end;
  now
    assume A \/ B = [#] T;
    then [#] T \ A = B \ A by XBOOLE_1:40;

end;

theorem Th2:
  for A,B being Subset of T holds A misses B iff B c= A`
proof
  let A,B be Subset of T;
  thus A misses B implies B c= A`
  proof

    then A /\ B = {}T by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
    then (A /\ B)` = [#]T;
    then B` \/ A` = [#] T by XBOOLE_1:54;
    then B`` c= A` by Th1;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  assume B c= A`;
  then B`` c= A`;
  then B` \/ A` = [#] T by Th1;
  then (A /\ B)` = [#] T by XBOOLE_1:54;
