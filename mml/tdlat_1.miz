:: 1. Preliminary Theorems on Subsets of Topological Spaces.

 reserve T for TopSpace;

theorem Th1:
 for A,B being Subset of T holds A \/ B = [#] T iff A` c= B
 proof
  let A,B be Subset of T;
  A1: now assume A \/ B = [#] T;
       then [#] T \ A = B \ A by XBOOLE_1:40;
       then A` = B \ A by PRE_TOPC:17;
       hence A` c= B by XBOOLE_1:36;
      end;
       now assume A` c= B;
   then A \/ A` c= A \/ B by XBOOLE_1:9;
   then [#] T c= A \/ B & A \/ B c= [#] T by PRE_TOPC:14,18;
   hence A \/ B = [#] T by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
  end;
 hence thesis by A1;
 end;

theorem Th2:
 for A,B being Subset of T holds A misses B iff B c= A`
 proof
  let A,B be Subset of T;
  thus A misses B implies B c= A`
   proof
    assume A misses B;
    then A /\ B = {}T by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
    then (A /\ B)` = ([#] T)`` by TOPS_1:8 .= [#]T;
     then B` \/ A` = [#] T by SUBSET_1:30;
    then B`` c= A` by Th1;
    hence B c= A`;
   end;
  assume B c= A`;
  then B`` c= A`;
  then B` \/ A` = [#] T by Th1;
  then (A /\ B)` = [#] T by SUBSET_1:30;
   then A /\ B = ([#] T)`;
  then A /\ B = {} T by TOPS_1:8;
  hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
 end;

theorem Th3:
 for A being Subset of T holds Cl Int Cl A c= Cl A
 proof
  let A be Subset of T;
       Int Cl A c= Cl A by TOPS_1:44;
  then Cl Int Cl A c= Cl Cl A by PRE_TOPC:49;
  hence Cl Int Cl A c= Cl A by TOPS_1:26;
 end;

theorem Th4:
 for A being Subset of T holds Int A c= Int Cl Int A
 proof
  let A be Subset of T;
       Int A c= Cl Int A by PRE_TOPC:48;
  then Int Int A c= Int Cl Int A by TOPS_1:48;
  hence Int A c= Int Cl Int A by TOPS_1:45;
 end;

theorem Th5:
 for A being Subset of T holds Int Cl A = Int Cl Int Cl A
 proof
  let A be Subset of T;
       Cl Int Cl A c= Cl A by Th3;
  then A1: Int Cl Int Cl A c= Int Cl A by TOPS_1:48;
       Int Cl A c= Cl Int Cl A by PRE_TOPC:48;
  then Int Int Cl A c= Int Cl Int Cl A by TOPS_1:48;
  then Int Cl A c= Int Cl Int Cl A by TOPS_1:45;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
 end;

   G = (D-Meet T)|[:Open_Domains_of T,Open_Domains_of T:]
    as Function of
     [:Open_Domains_of T,Open_Domains_of T:],Domains_of T by FUNCT_2:38;
      for A being Element of Open_Domains_of T,
       B being Element of Open_Domains_of T
        holds F.(A,B) = G.(A,B)
  proof
    let A be Element of Open_Domains_of T,
        B be Element of Open_Domains_of T;
    thus F.(A,B) = (D-Meet T).(A,B) by Th37
                .= (D-Meet T) . [A,B] by BINOP_1:def 1
                .= ((D-Meet T)|[:Open_Domains_of T,
                     Open_Domains_of T:]) . [A,B] by FUNCT_1:72
                .= G.(A,B) by BINOP_1:def 1;

 hence thesis by BINOP_1:2;

theorem
  Open_Domains_Lattice T is SubLattice of Domains_Lattice T
proof
 set L = Domains_Lattice T, OL = Open_Domains_Lattice T;
 A1: L = LattStr(#Domains_of T,D-Union T,D-Meet T#) by Def4;
 A2: OL = LattStr(#Open_Domains_of T,OPD-Union T,OPD-Meet T#) by Def12;
 hence the carrier of OL c= the carrier of L by A1,Th35;
 thus the L_join of OL = (the L_join of L) | [:the carrier of OL,
   the carrier of OL:] by A1,A2,Th42;
 thus the L_meet of OL = (the L_meet of L) | [:the carrier of OL,
   the carrier of OL:] by A1,A2,Th43;
end;
