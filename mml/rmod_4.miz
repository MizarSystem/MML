                i in Seg(len f) by A26,A36,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
            then A40: i in dom f by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
         thus Fp.k = f.(P.k) by A38,FUNCT_1:23

     suppose A41: a = 0.R;
       hence Sum(L * a) = Sum(ZeroLC(V)) by Th60

theorem Th79:
 Sum(- L) = - Sum(L)
  proof
   thus Sum(- L) = Sum(L * (- 1_ R)) by Def13
              .= Sum(L) * (- 1_ R) by Th78
              .= - Sum(L) by MOD_1:37;
  end;

theorem
     Sum(L1 - L2) = Sum(L1) - Sum(L2)
  proof
   thus Sum(L1 - L2) = Sum(L1 + (- L2)) by Def14
                  .= Sum(L1) + Sum(- L2) by Th77
                  .= Sum(L1) + (- Sum(L2)) by Th79
                  .= Sum(L1) - Sum(L2) by RLVECT_1:def 11;
