theorem
  Sum(T \+\ S) = Sum(T \/ S) - Sum(T /\ S)
proof
  T \+\ S = (T \/ S) \ (T /\ S) by XBOOLE_1:101;

    then
A19: v = Sum(f) + Sum(g) by A1,Th77;
    Sum(f) in Lin(A) & Sum(g) in Lin(B) by Th86;

  then
A20: Lin(A \/ B) is Submodule of Lin(A) + Lin(B) by RMOD_2:36;
  Lin(A) is Submodule of Lin(A \/ B) & Lin(B) is Submodule of Lin(A \/ B)

  then Lin(A) + Lin(B) is Submodule of Lin(A \/ B) by RMOD_3:40;
  hence thesis by A20,RMOD_2:33;
end;

theorem
  Lin(A /\ B) is Submodule of Lin(A) /\ Lin(B)
proof
  Lin(A /\ B) is Submodule of Lin(A) & Lin(A /\ B) is Submodule of Lin(B)
  by Th92,XBOOLE_1:17;
  hence thesis by RMOD_3:24;
