   proof
    assume that A1: Z is finite and A2: Z c= rng f;
    per cases;
     suppose A3: Z = {};
     take Y = {};
     thus Y c= dom f & Y is finite by XBOOLE_1:2;

    reconsider AA = rng g as non empty set by A4,A5,RELAT_1:65;
    A7: for X being set st X in AA holds X <> {}
        proof
         let X be set; assume X in AA;
         then consider x such that A8: x in dom g and A9: g.x=X by
FUNCT_1:def 5;
              g.x = f"{x} by A5,A6,A8;

        x in f.:Y iff x in Z
     proof
