 reserve U1,U2,U3 for Universal_Algebra,
         m,n for Nat,
         a for set,
         A for non empty set,
         h for Function of U1,U2;

theorem Th1:
 for f,g be Function, C be set st rng f c= C holds (g|C)*f = g*f
  proof
   let f,g be Function, C be set such that A1: rng f c= C;
      (g|C)*f = g*(C|f) by MONOID_1:2
          .= g*f by A1,RELAT_1:125;
   hence thesis;
  end;

theorem Th2:
 for I be set, C be Subset of I holds C* c= I*
  proof
   let I be set, C be Subset of I;
   thus C* c= I*
   proof
     let a; assume a in C*;
     then reconsider p = a as FinSequence of C by FINSEQ_1:def 11;
        rng p c= I by XBOOLE_1:1;
     then p is FinSequence of I by FINSEQ_1:def 4;

theorem
    for f be Function, C be set st f is Function-yielding holds
  f|C is Function-yielding
  proof
    let f be Function, C be set such that
A1:   f is Function-yielding;
       now let i be set such that A2: i in dom (f|C);
         dom (f|C) c= dom f by RELAT_1:89;
      then f.i is Function by A1,A2,FUNCOP_1:def 6;
      hence (f|C).i is Function by A2,FUNCT_1:70;
    end;
    hence thesis by FUNCOP_1:def 6;

theorem Th4:
 for I be set, C be Subset of I, M be ManySortedSet of I holds (M|C)# = M#|(C*)

   let I be set, C be Subset of I, M be ManySortedSet of I;
A1: dom (M# ) = I* by PBOOLE:def 3;
A2: C* c= I* by Th2;
   then dom (M#|(C*)) = C* by A1,RELAT_1:91;
   then reconsider D = M#|(C*) as ManySortedSet of C* by PBOOLE:def 3;
      for i being Element of C* holds (M#|(C*)).i = product((M|C)*i)
   proof
    let i be Element of C*;

     hereby assume a in (D.i);
       then a in M#.i by A3,FUNCT_1:70;
       then a in product(M*i) by A4,PBOOLE:def 19;
       then consider g be Function such that

       A8: for x be set st x in dom (M*i) holds g.x in (M*i).x by CARD_3:def 5;
       take g;
       thus a = g by A6;
           rng i c= C;
        hence dom g = dom ((M|C)*i) by A7,Th1;
       thus for a st a in dom ((M|C)*i) holds g.a in ((M|C)*i).a
       proof
         let a such that A9: a in dom ((M|C)*i);
         A10: rng i c= C;
         then a in dom (M*i) by A9,Th1;

     given g be Function such that
     A11: a = g and

     proof
