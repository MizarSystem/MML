begin

reserve p,p1,p2,q for Point of TOP-REAL 2,
  f,g,g1,g2 for FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
  n,m,i,j,k for Element of NAT,
  G for Go-board,
  x for set;

Lm1: now
  let f,k;
A1: dom(f|k)=Seg len(f|k) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  assume
A2: len f=k+1;
  then
A3: len (f|k)=k by FINSEQ_1:59,NAT_1:11;
  assume k<>0;
  then
A4: 0+1<=k by NAT_1:13;
  assume
A5: f is unfolded;
A6: k<=k+1 by NAT_1:11;
  then
A7: k in dom f by A2,A4,FINSEQ_3:25;
  thus f|k is unfolded
  proof
    let n be Nat;
    set f1 = f|k;
    assume that
A8: 1<=n and
A9: n+2 <= len f1;
    reconsider n as Element of NAT by ORDINAL1:def 12;

    then
A14: LSeg(f1,n+1)=LSeg(f,n+1) by A10,A13,TOPREAL3:17;
    f1/.(n+1)=f/.(n+1) by A7,A3,A1,A10,FINSEQ_4:71;

theorem Th1:
  (for n st n in dom f ex i,j st [i,j] in Indices G & f/.n=G*(i,j))
& f is one-to-one unfolded s.n.c. special implies ex g st g is_sequence_on G &
g is one-to-one unfolded s.n.c. special & L~f = L~g & f/.1 = g/.1 & f/.len f =
  g/.len g & len f <= len g
proof
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means for f st len f = $1 & (for n st n in dom f

special ex g st g is_sequence_on G & g is one-to-one unfolded s.n.c. special &
  L~f=L~g & f/.1=g/.1 & f/.len f=g/.len g & len f<=len g;
A1: for k st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof
    let k such that

    let f such that
A3: len f=k+1 and
A4: for n st n in dom f ex i,j st [i,j] in Indices G & f/.n=G*(i,j) and
A5: f is one-to-one and
A6: f is unfolded and

A12:    n+1 in dom g;
        n=1 by A10,A11,TARSKI:def 1;
        hence for i1,i2,j1,j2 be Element of NAT st [i1,i2] in Indices G & [j1,
j2] in Indices G & g/.n=G*(i1,i2) & g/.(n+1)=G*(j1,j2) holds abs(i1-j1)+abs(i2-
        j2)=1 by A10,A12,TARSKI:def 1;
      end;
      hence g is_sequence_on G by A4,GOBOARD1:def 9;

FINSEQ_4:71;

  proof
    let f such that
A1319: len f=0 and
A1320: ( for n st n in dom f ex i,j st [i,j] in Indices G & f/.n=G*(i,j))
    & f is one-to-one unfolded s.n.c. special;
    take g=f;
    f= {} by A1319;
    then
    for n holds n in dom g & n+1 in dom g implies for m,k,i,j st [m,k] in
Indices G & [i,j] in Indices G & g/.n=G*(m,k) & g/.(n+1)=G*(i,j) holds abs(m-i)
    +abs(k-j)=1;
    hence thesis by A1320,GOBOARD1:def 9;
  end;
  for k holds P[k] from NAT_1:sch 1(A1318,A1);
  hence thesis;

theorem
  (for n st n in dom f ex i,j st [i,j] in Indices G & f/.n=G*(i,j)) & f
is being_S-Seq implies ex g st g is_sequence_on G & g is being_S-Seq & L~f = L~
  g & f/.1 = g/.1 & f/.len f = g/.len g & len f<=len g
proof
  assume that
A1: for n st n in dom f ex i,j st [i,j] in Indices G & f/.n=G*(i,j) and
A2: f is being_S-Seq;
  f is one-to-one & f is unfolded s.n.c. special by A2,TOPREAL1:def 8;
  then consider g such that
A3: g is_sequence_on G and
A4: g is one-to-one unfolded s.n.c. special and
A5: L~f = L~g & f/.1 = g/.1 & f/.len f = g/.len g and
A6: len f <= len g by A1,Th1;
  take g;
  thus g is_sequence_on G by A3;
  2<=len f by A2,TOPREAL1:def 8;
  then 2<=len g by A6,XXREAL_0:2;
  hence g is being_S-Seq by A4,TOPREAL1:def 8;
  thus thesis by A5,A6;
