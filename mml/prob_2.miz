theorem
Th4: for r,r1,r2,r3 st (r <> 0 & r1 <> 0) holds
  (r3/r1 = r2/r iff r3 * r = r2 * r1)
  proof let r,r1,r2,r3; assume that
 A1: r <> 0 and
 A2: r1 <> 0;
  thus r3/r1 = r2/r implies r3 * r = r2 * r1
    proof assume A3: r3/r1 = r2/r;
       r3 * r = r3/r1 * r1 * r by A2,XCMPLX_1:88

theorem
Th5: (seq is convergent & for n holds seq1.n = r - seq.n) implies
  seq1 is convergent & lim seq1 = r - lim seq
  proof assume that
 A1: seq is convergent and
 A2: for n holds seq1.n = r - seq.n;
  consider r1 be real number such that
 A3: for r2 be real number st 0<r2
  ex n st for m st n<=m holds abs(seq.m-r1)<r2 by A1,SEQ_2:def 6;
 A4:now let r2 be real number; assume
       0 < r2; then consider n such that
   A5: for m st n <= m holds abs(seq.m - r1) < r2 by A3;
   A6:now let m such that
      A7: n <= m;
          abs(seq.m - r1) = abs(-(seq.m - r1)) by COMPLEX1:138
                     .= abs(r1 - r + (r - seq.m))
                     .= abs(seq1.m + - (-(r1 - r))) by A2
                     .= abs(seq1.m - (r - r1));
       hence abs(seq1.m - (r - r1)) < r2 by A5,A7;
      end;
    take n; thus
       for m st n <= m holds abs(seq1.m - (r - r1)) < r2 by A6;
    end;
  hence A8: seq1 is convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
     lim seq = r1 by A1,A3,SEQ_2:def 7;
  hence thesis by A4,A8,SEQ_2:def 7;
