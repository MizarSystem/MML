theorem Th4:
  for r,r1,r2,r3 st r <> 0 & r1 <> 0 holds (r3/r1 = r2/r iff r3 * r
  = r2 * r1)
proof
  let r,r1,r2,r3;
  assume that
A1: r <> 0 and
A2: r1 <> 0;
  thus r3/r1 = r2/r implies r3 * r = r2 * r1
  proof
    assume

theorem Th5:
  (seq is convergent & for n holds seq1.n = r - seq.n) implies seq1

proof

  consider r1 be real number such that
A3: for r2 be real number st 0<r2 ex n st for m st n<=m holds abs(seq.m-
  r1)<r2 by A1,SEQ_2:def 6;
A4: now
    let r2 be real number;
    assume
    0 < r2;
    then consider n such that
A5: for m st n <= m holds abs(seq.m - r1) < r2 by A3;
    take n;
    now
      let m such that

        .= abs(seq1.m + - (-(r1 - r))) by A2

      hence abs(seq1.m - (r - r1)) < r2 by A5,A6;
    end;
    hence for m st n <= m holds abs(seq1.m - (r - r1)) < r2;
  end;
  hence

  thus (P.|.A3.B * P.A3)/((P.|.A1.B * P.A1 + P.|.A2.B * P.A2) + P.|. A3.B * P.
  A3) = (P.|.A3.B * P.A3)/P.B by A2,A3,A4,A5,Th45
    .= P.|.B.A3 by A1,A4,Th49;
end;

theorem
  for A,B,P st 0 < P.B holds 1 - P.([#] Sigma \ A)/P.B <= P.|.B.A
proof
  let A,B,P;
  assume
A1: 0 < P.B;
  P.B + P.A - 1 <= P.(A /\ B) by Th25;
  then P.B + -(1 - P.A) <= P.(A /\ B);
  then P.B + -P.([#] Sigma \ A) <= P.(A /\ B) by PROB_1:68;
  then (P.B + -P.([#] Sigma \ A))/P.B <= P.(A /\ B)/P.B by A1,XREAL_1:74;
  then (P.B - P.([#] Sigma \ A))/P.B <= P.|.B.A by A1,Def7;
  then P.B/P.B - P.([#] Sigma \ A)/P.B <= P.|.B.A by XCMPLX_1:121;
  hence thesis by A1,XCMPLX_1:60;
