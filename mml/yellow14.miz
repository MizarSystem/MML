  proof
    let X be set,
        Y be Subset of X;
    set f = id X;
A1: X = {} implies Y = {} by XBOOLE_1:3;
        X = {} implies X = {};
then A2: f|Y is Function of Y,X by FUNCT_2:38;
then A3: dom (f|Y) = Y by A1,FUNCT_2:def 1;
    hereby
      let y be set;
      assume y in rng (f|Y);

theorem Th3:

  proof
    let f be Function,
        a, b be set;
        dom (a .--> b) = {a} by CQC_LANG:5;
    then a in dom (a .--> b) by TARSKI:def 1;
