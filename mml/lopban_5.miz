theorem Th3:
:: Baire category theorem - Banach space version
  for X be RealBanachSpace, Y be SetSequence of X st union rng Y =
the carrier of X & (for n be Element of NAT holds Y.n is closed) holds ex n0 be
  Element of NAT, r be Real, x0 be Point of X st 0 < r & Ball (x0,r) c= Y.n0
proof
  let X be RealBanachSpace, Y be SetSequence of X;
  assume that
A1: union rng Y = the carrier of X and
A2: for n be Element of NAT holds Y.n is closed;
  now
    let n be Element of NAT;
    reconsider Yn = Y.n as Subset of TopSpaceNorm X;
    Y.n is closed by A2;
    then Yn is closed by NORMSP_2:15;
    then Yn` is open by TOPS_1:29;
    hence (Y.n)` in Family_open_set MetricSpaceNorm X by PRE_TOPC:def 5;
  end;
  then consider
  n0 be Element of NAT, r be Real, xx0 be Point of MetricSpaceNorm X
  such that
A3: 0 < r & Ball(xx0,r) c= Y.n0 by A1,NORMSP_2:1;
  consider x0 be Point of X such that

theorem Th4:
  for X,Y be RealNormSpace, f be bounded LinearOperator of X,Y
holds f is_Lipschitzian_on the carrier of X & f is_continuous_on the carrier of
  X & for x be Point of X holds f is_continuous_in x
proof
  let X,Y be RealNormSpace, f be bounded LinearOperator of X,Y;
  consider K being Real such that
A1: 0 <= K and
A2: for x being VECTOR of X holds ||. f.x .|| <= K * ||. x .|| by
  LOPBAN_1:def 9;
A3: now
    let x,y be Point of X;
    assume that
    x in the carrier of X and
    y in the carrier of X;
    f/.x -f/.y =f.x +(-1)* f.y by RLVECT_1:29;
    then f/.x -f/.y = f.x + f.((-1)*y) by LOPBAN_1:def 6;
    then f/.x -f/.y = f.(x+(-1)*y) by LOPBAN_1:def 5;
    then
A4: f/.x -f/.y =f.(x+-y) by RLVECT_1:29;
    0<=||. x-y .|| by NORMSP_1:8;
    then ||.f/.x -f/.y .||<=K*||. x-y .||+||. x-y .|| by A2,A4,
    XREAL_1:40;
    hence ||. f/.x -f/.y .|| <= (K+1) * ||. x-y .||;
  end;
  dom f =the carrier of X by FUNCT_2:def 1;
  hence f is_Lipschitzian_on the carrier of X by A1,A3,NFCONT_1:def 13;
  hence
A5: f is_continuous_on the carrier of X by NFCONT_1:52;
  hereby
    let x be Point of X;
    f|(the carrier of X) = f by RELSET_1:34;
    hence f is_continuous_in x by A5,NFCONT_1:def 11;
