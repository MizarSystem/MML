theorem Th3:
  {x} c= {x,y,z}

proof
  x in X \/ {y} iff x in X or x in {y} by XBOOLE_0:def 3;

  for X,Y for f being Function holds f.:(Y \ f"X) = f.:Y \ X
proof

    thus x in f.:(Y \ f"X) implies x in f.:Y \ X
    proof
      assume

    hence x in f.:(Y \ f"X) by A6,A8,FUNCT_1:def 12;
  end;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:2;

reserve X,Y for non empty set,
  f for Function of X,Y;
