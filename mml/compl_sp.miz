  well_dist(a,X) is Reflexive implies M is Reflexive ) & ( well_dist(a,X) is
  symmetric implies M is symmetric ) & ( well_dist(a,X) is triangle Reflexive
implies M is triangle ) & (well_dist(a,X) is discerning Reflexive implies M is

  proof
    let x;
    assume x in rng S;
    then consider y such that
A21: y in dom S and

    x={s.y} by A10,A21,A22;
    hence thesis by A23;

  now
    let x be set;
    assume x in dom S;
    then S.x={s.x} by A10;
    hence S.x is non empty;
  end;
  then S is non-empty by FUNCT_1:def 15;
  then consider R be non-empty closed SetSequence of TW such that
A24: R is non-ascending and
A25: F is locally_finite & S is one-to-one implies meet R = {} and

  reconsider R9=R as non-empty SetSequence of W;
A27: now

    x=[f.x1,b] by A7,A34,A35;
    then well_dist(a,X).(x,y)=dist(b,a)+dist(a,b) by A30,A33,Def10;
    hence dist(x,y)=2*dist(a,b);

A50:  y in rngs by A46,A48,A49,TARSKI:def 1;
      x=y or x<>y;
      hence dist(x,y)<=2*dist(a,b) by A19,A27,A45,A50,METRIC_1:1;
    end;
    then SI is bounded by A19,TBSP_1:def 9;
    hence R9.i is bounded by A36,Th8;
  end;
  then reconsider R9 as non-empty bounded SetSequence of W by Def1;
  take R9;
  thus R9 is closed & R9 is non-ascending by A24,Th7;
  for x,y be Point of W st x<>y & x in rngs & y in rngs holds dist(x,y)>=
  2*dist(a,b) by A27;

theorem
  ex M be non empty MetrSpace st M is complete & ex S be non-empty
bounded SetSequence of M st S is closed & S is non-ascending & meet S is empty
proof
  reconsider D=DiscreteSpace 2 as non empty MetrSpace;
  reconsider a=0,b=1 as Point of D by NAT_1:45;
  TopSpaceMetr D is compact by COMPTS_1:27;
  then
A1: D is complete by TBSP_1:10;
A2: 1=dist(a,b) by METRIC_1:def 11;
  then
A3: ex S be non-empty bounded SetSequence of WellSpace(a,NAT) st S is closed
  & S is non-ascending & meet S is empty by A1,Th43;
  WellSpace(a,NAT) is complete by A2,A1,Th43;
  hence thesis by A3;
