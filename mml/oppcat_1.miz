:: Opposite Category

theorem Th1:
   CatStr (#the Objects of C, the Morphisms of C,the Cod of C, the Dom of C,
           ~(the Comp of C), the Id of C#) is Category
 proof
  set M = the Morphisms of C,
      d = the Cod of C, c = the Dom of C,
      p = ~(the Comp of C), i = the Id of C;
    now
   thus
A1:   for f,g being Element of M holds [g,f] in dom(p) iff d.g=c.f
    proof let f,g be Element of M;
       [g,f] in dom(p) iff [f,g] in dom (the Comp of C) by FUNCT_4:43;
     hence thesis by CAT_1:def 8;
    end;
A2:  for f,g being Element of M st d.g = c.f
       holds p.[g,f] = (the Comp of C).[f,g]
    proof let f,g be Element of M;
     assume d.g = c.f; then [g,f] in dom(p) by A1;
      hence thesis by FUNCT_4:44;
    end;
   thus
A3:  for f,g being Element of M
       st d.g = c.f holds d.(p.[g,f]) = d.f & c.(p.[g,f]) = c.g
    proof let f,g be Element of M;
       d.g = c.f implies p.[g,f] = (the Comp of C).[f,g] by A2;
     hence thesis by CAT_1:def 8;
    end;
   thus for f,g,h being Element of M
      st d.h = c.g & d.g = c.f holds p.[h,p.[g,f]] = p.[p.[h,g],f]
    proof let f,g,h be Element of M; assume
A4:    d.h = c.g & d.g = c.f;
     then [g,f] in dom p & [h,g] in dom p by A1;
     then p.[g,f] = (the Comp of C).[f,g] & p.[h,g] = (the Comp of C).[g,h] &
        c.(p.[g,f]) = c.g & d.(p.[h,g]) = d.g &
        p.[g,f] is Element of M & p.[h,g] is Element of M by A2,A3,A4,PARTFUN1:
27;
     then p.[h,p.[g,f]] = (the Comp of C).[(the Comp of C).[f,g],h] &
        p.[p.[h,g],f] = (the Comp of C).[f,(the Comp of C).[g,h]] by A2,A4;
     hence thesis by A4,CAT_1:def 8;
    end;
   let b be Element of (the Objects of C);
   thus
A5:    d.(i.b) = b & c.(i.b) = b by CAT_1:def 8;
   thus for f being Element of M st c.f = b holds p.[i.b,f] = f
    proof let f be Element of M;
       c.f = b implies p.[i.b,f] = (the Comp of C).[f,i.b] by A2,A5;
     hence thesis by CAT_1:def 8;
    end;
   let g be Element of M;
     d.g = b implies p.[g,i.b] = (the Comp of C).[i.b,g] by A2,A5;
   hence d.g = b implies p.[g,i.b] = g by CAT_1:def 8;
