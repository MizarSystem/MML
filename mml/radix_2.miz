theorem Th2:
  for a,b be Integer, n be Nat st n>0 holds
    ((a mod n)+(b mod n)) mod n = (a + (b mod n)) mod n &
    ((a mod n)+(b mod n)) mod n = ((a mod n) + b) mod n
proof
  let a,b be Integer;
  let n be Nat;

   .= (a div n)*n+0 by XCMPLX_1:14;
   then n divides (a + (b mod n))-((a mod n)+(b mod n)) by INT_1:def 9;
   then (a + (b mod n)),((a mod n)+(b mod n)) are_congruent_mod n by INT_2:19;
   hence ((a mod n)+(b mod n)) mod n = (a + (b mod n)) mod n by A1,INT_3:12;

proof
  let a,b be Integer;
