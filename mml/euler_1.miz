reserve a,b,c,k,l,m,n for Nat,
        i,j,x,y for Integer;

Lm1:0 <= k & 0 <= n implies k gcd n = k hcf n
proof
  assume 0 <= k & 0 <= n;
  then abs(k) = k & abs(n) = n by ABSVALUE:def 1;
  hence thesis by INT_2:def 3;
end;

Lm2:a,(b qua Integer) are_relative_prime iff
                                    a,b are_relative_prime
proof
  thus a,(b qua Integer) are_relative_prime implies
                                    a,b are_relative_prime
  proof
    assume a,(b qua Integer) are_relative_prime;
    then A1:a gcd b = 1 by INT_2:def 4;
      a >= 0 & b >= 0 by NAT_1:18;
    then a hcf b = 1 by A1,Lm1;

  assume a,b are_relative_prime;
  then A2:a hcf b = 1 by INT_2:def 6;
    a >= 0 & b >= 0 by NAT_1:18;
  then a gcd b = 1 by A2,Lm1;
  hence thesis by INT_2:def 4;
end;

Lm3:i > 0 & a = i & k > 0 implies i mod k = a mod k
proof
  assume A1:i > 0 & a = i & k > 0;
  then i mod k = a - (i div k)*k by INT_1:def 8;
  then a - ((i div k)*k - (i div k)*k) = i mod k + (i div k)*k by XCMPLX_1:37;
  then A2:a - 0 = i mod k + (i div k)*k by XCMPLX_1:14;
    0/k < i/k by A1,REAL_1:73;
  then 0 <= i/k & 0 <> i/k & i/k <= [\ i/k /]+1 by INT_1:52;

  hence thesis by A3,NAT_1:def 2;
end;

Lm4:
  a = i & m > 0 & m divides i iff a = i & m > 0 & m divides a
proof
  thus a = i & m > 0 & m divides i implies a = i & m > 0 & m divides a
  proof
   assume A1: a = i & m > 0 & m divides i;
    then consider j such that
      A2: i = m*j by INT_1:def 9;
      j >= 0
    proof
      assume not j >= 0;
      then m*j < 0*j by A1,REAL_1:71;
      hence contradiction by A1,A2,NAT_1:18;
    end;
    then reconsider j as Nat by INT_1:16;
      a = m*j by A1,A2;
    hence thesis by A1,NAT_1:def 3;

  assume A3: a = i & m > 0 & m divides a;
  then ex j being Nat st a = m*j by NAT_1:def 3;
  hence thesis by A3,INT_1:def 9;

Lm5:k <> 0 & ([\ j/k /]) + 1 >= j/k implies k >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k)
proof

  A2:k >= 0 by NAT_1:18;
    ([\ j/k /]) + 1 + -1 >= j/k + -1 by A1,AXIOMS:24;
  then ([\ j/k /]) + (1 + -1) >= j/k + -1 by XCMPLX_1:1;
  then ([\ j/k /]) >= j/k -1 by XCMPLX_0:def 8;
  then (([\ j/k /]))*k >= ((j/k)-1)*k by A2,AXIOMS:25;
  then -(((j/k) - 1)*k) >= -(([\ j/k /])*k) by REAL_1:50;
  then j + -(((j/k) - 1)*k) >= j + -(([\ j/k /])*k) by AXIOMS:24;
  then j - (((j/k) - 1)*k) >= j + -(([\ j/k /])*k) by XCMPLX_0:def 8;
  then j - (((j/k) - 1)*k) >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k) by XCMPLX_0:def 8;
  then j - ((j/k)*k - 1*k) >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k) by XCMPLX_1:40;
  then j -(j - k) >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k) by A1,XCMPLX_1:88;
  then j - j + k >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k) by XCMPLX_1:37;
  then j + -j + k >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k) by XCMPLX_0:def 8;
  then 0 + k >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k) by XCMPLX_0:def 6;
  hence k >= j - (([\ j/k /])*k);

theorem Th1:
  for k, n being natural number holds k in n iff k < n
proof
  let k, n be natural number;
A1:k in NAT & n in NAT by ORDINAL2:def 21;
  thus k in n implies k < n
  proof
    assume k in n;
    then k in {l : l < n} by AXIOMS:30;
    then ex j being Nat st k = j & j < n;

  per cases by A1,A2,INT_2:def 5;
    suppose k hcf n = 1;

                                 iff n is prime & k in n & not k in {0}
proof
  set X = {kk where kk is Nat : n,kk are_relative_prime & kk >= 1 & kk <= n};
  thus n is prime & k in X implies n is prime & k in n & not k in {0}
  proof
    assume A1:n is prime & k in X;
    then A2:ex kk being Nat st
             kk = k & n,kk are_relative_prime & kk >= 1 & kk <= n;

  A2:n divides (a + b) & n divides b by NAT_1:def 5;
  then n divides a by NAT_1:57;
  then n divides a hcf b by A2,NAT_LAT:32;
  then A3: n <= 1 + 0 & n >= 0 by A1,NAT_1:18,54;
  per cases by A3,NAT_1:27;
    suppose n = 1;
    hence (a + b) hcf b = 1;
    end;
    suppose n = 0;
    then (a + b) = 0 & b = 0 by INT_2:5;
  hence thesis by A1;
