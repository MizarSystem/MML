theorem
  for a,b,c being POINT of G st a on b*c holds b=a or b=c or c on b*a
proof
  let a,b,c be POINT of G;
  assume that
A1: a on b*c & b<>a and
A2: b<>c;
  b*c = c*b by A2,Th16;
  hence thesis by A1,A2,Th35;

theorem
  for e,x1,x2,p1,p2 being POINT of G for H,I being LINE of G st x1 on I
& x2 on I & e |'I & x1<>x2 & p1<>e & p2 <>e & p1 on e*x1 & p2 on e*x2 holds ex
  r being POINT of G st r on p1*p2 & r on H & r<>e
proof
  let e,x1,x2,p1,p2 be POINT of G;
  let H,I be LINE of G such that
A1: x1 on I and
A2: x2 on I and
A3: e|'I and

  then
A11: L1 <> L2 by A1,A2,A3,A4,A9,INCPROJ:def 9;
  then
A12: p1<>p2 by A5,A7,A8,A9,A10,INCPROJ:def 9;
  then p2 on L by Th16;
  then
A13: L<>L1 by A6,A8,A9,A10,A11,INCPROJ:def 9;
  consider r being POINT of G such that
A14: r on L and
A15: r on H by INCPROJ:def 14;
  p1 on L by A12,Th16;
  then r<>e by A5,A7,A14,A9,A13,INCPROJ:def 9;
