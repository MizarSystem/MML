theorem :: BORSUK_6:2
 a <= 1/2 implies 0 <= 1 - 2 * a
  proof
    assume a <= 1/2;
     then 2 * a <= 2 * (1/2) by Lm6;
     then 2 * a + 0 <= 1;
    hence thesis by Lm33;

theorem :: BORSUK_6:3
 a >= 1/2 implies 2 * a - 1 >= 0
  proof
    assume a >= 1/2;
     then 2 * a >= 2 * (1/2) by Lm6;
     then 2 * a >= 1 + 0;
    hence thesis by Lm33;

begin :: numeral 3

theorem :: JGRAPH_3:7`1
 0 < a implies a/3 < a
  proof
   assume 0<a;
   then A2: 0<a/3 by Lm99;
   then A3:0+a/3<a/3+a/3 by LTh4;
       a/3+a/3+0<a/3+a/3+a/3 by A2,LTh4;
   hence a/3<a by A3,Th2;
  end;

theorem :: SEQ_4:4
 0 < a implies 0 < a/3
  proof
   assume 0<a;
    then 0/3<a/3 by Lm42;
   hence thesis;
  end;

begin :: numeral 4

theorem :: JGRAPH_3:7`2
 0 < a implies a/4 < a
  proof
   assume A1:0<a;
   A4: 0<a/4 by A1,Lm99;
   then A5:0+a/4<a/4+a/4 by LTh4;
   a/4< a/4+a/4+a/4 by A5,A4,LTh4;
   then a/4+a/4<a/4+a/4+a/4+a/4 by LTh4;
   hence a/4<a by A5,Th2;
  end;

theorem :: SEQ_2:3`2
 0 < a implies 0 < a/4
  proof
   assume
A1: 0<a;
   0/4=0;
   hence 0<a/4 by A1,Lm42;

theorem :: REAL_2:64
  for a,b st b<>0 ex c st a=b/c
  proof let a,b;
   assume
Z:  b<>0;
    then consider c being complex number such that
W:   a=b/c by XCMPLX_1:234;
   per cases;
   suppose c = 0;
    hence thesis by W;
   end;
   suppose c <> 0;
     then b/c <> 0 by Z,XCMPLX_1:50;
     then c = b/a by W,XCMPLX_1:54;
     then reconsider c as real number;
     take c;
    thus thesis by W;
