  proof
    let T be complete continuous TopLattice such that
A1: T is Lawson;
    let x, y be Point of T such that
A2: x <> y;
    reconsider x9 = x, y9 = y as Element of T;
A3: for x being Element of T holds waybelow x is non empty directed;
    per cases by A2,ORDERS_2:25;
    suppose
      not y9 <= x9;
      then consider u being Element of T such that
A4:   u << y9 and
A5:   not u <= x9 by A3,WAYBEL_3:24;
      take V = (uparrow u)`, W = wayabove u;
      thus V is open & W is open by A1,Th39,Th40;
      thus x in V by A5,YELLOW_9:1;
      thus y in W by A4;
A6:   V` = uparrow u;
      W c= uparrow u by WAYBEL_3:11;
      hence thesis by A6,SUBSET_1:43;
    end;
    suppose
      not x9 <= y9;

A7:   u << x9 and
A8:   not u <= y9 by A3,WAYBEL_3:24;
      take W = wayabove u, V = (uparrow u)`;
      thus W is open & V is open by A1,Th39,Th40;
