begin :: Preliminaries

reserve n for Element of NAT,
  a, b, r, w for real number,
  x, y, z for Point of TOP-REAL n,
  e for Point of Euclid n;

theorem
  x - y - z = x - z - y by JORDAN2C:9;

theorem Th2:
  x + y = x + z implies y = z
proof
  assume
  x + y = x + z;
  then x - x + y = x + z - x by JORDAN2C:9;
  then x - x = 0.TOP-REAL n & x - x + y = x - x + z by EUCLID:46,JORDAN2C:9;
  hence y = 0.TOP-REAL n + z by EUCLID:31
    .= z by EUCLID:31;
end;

theorem Th3:
  n is non empty implies x <> x + 1.REAL n
proof
A1: 0.REAL n = 0.TOP-REAL n & x = x + 0.TOP-REAL n by EUCLID:31,70;
  assume
  n is non empty & x = x + 1.REAL n;
  hence thesis by A1,Th2,REVROT_1:19;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for x being set holds x = (1-r)*y + r*z implies (x = y iff r = 0
  or y = z) & (x = z iff r = 1 or y = z)
proof
  let x be set;
  assume
A1: x = (1-r)*y + r*z;
  hereby
    assume
    x = y;
    then 0.TOP-REAL n = (1-r)*y + r*z - y by A1,EUCLID:46
      .= (1-r)*y - y + r*z by JORDAN2C:9
      .= (1-r)*y - 1 * y + r*z by EUCLID:33
      .= (1-r-1)*y + r*z by EUCLID:54
      .= (-r)*y + r*z
      .= r*z - r*y by EUCLID:44
      .= r*(z-y) by EUCLID:53;
    then r = 0 or z-y = 0.TOP-REAL n by EUCLID:35;
    hence r = 0 or y = z by EUCLID:47;
  end;
  hereby
    assume
A2: r = 0 or y = z;
    per cases by A2;
    suppose
      r = 0;
      hence x = y + 0 * z by A1,EUCLID:33
        .= y + 0.TOP-REAL n by EUCLID:33
        .= y by EUCLID:31;
    end;
    suppose
      z = y;
      hence x = (1-r+r)*y by A1,EUCLID:37
        .= y by EUCLID:33;
    end;
  end;
  hereby
    assume
    x = z;
    then 0.TOP-REAL n = (1-r)*y + r*z - z by A1,EUCLID:46
      .= (1-r)*y + (r*z - z) by EUCLID:49
      .= (1-r)*y + (r*z + (-1)*z) by EUCLID:43
      .= (1-r)*y + (-1+r)*z by EUCLID:37
      .= (1-r)*y + (-(1-r))*z
      .= (1-r)*y - (1-r)*z by EUCLID:44
      .= (1-r)*(y-z) by EUCLID:53;
    then 1-r+r = 0+r or y-z = 0.TOP-REAL n by EUCLID:35;
    hence r = 1 or y = z by EUCLID:47;
  end;
  assume
A3: r = 1 or y = z;
  per cases by A3;
  suppose
    r = 1;
    hence x = 0.TOP-REAL n + 1 * z by A1,EUCLID:33
      .= 1 * z by EUCLID:31
      .= z by EUCLID:33;
  end;
  suppose
    y = z;
    hence x = (1-r+r)*z by A1,EUCLID:37
      .= z by EUCLID:33;
  end;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for f being real-valued FinSequence holds |.f.|^2 = Sum sqr f
proof
  let f be real-valued FinSequence;
  Sum sqr f >= 0 by RVSUM_1:116;
  hence thesis by SQUARE_1:def 4;
end;

theorem Th6:
  for M being non empty MetrSpace, z1, z2, z3 being Point of M st
  z1 <> z2 & z1 in cl_Ball(z3,r) & z2 in cl_Ball(z3,r) holds r > 0
proof
  let M be non empty MetrSpace, z1, z2, z3 be Point of M such that
A1: z1 <> z2 and
A2: z1 in cl_Ball(z3,r) and
A3: z2 in cl_Ball(z3,r);
  now
    assume
    r = 0;
    then
A4: cl_Ball(z3,r) = {z3} by TOPREAL6:64;
    then z1 = z3 by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
    hence contradiction by A1,A3,A4,TARSKI:def 1;
  end;
  hence thesis by A2,TOPREAL6:63;
