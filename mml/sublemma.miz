  p '&' q is conjunctive by QC_LANG1:def 19;

theorem Th47:

theorem Th48:
  for p holds still_not-bound_in p c= Bound_Vars(p)
proof
  defpred P[Element of QC-WFF] means still_not-bound_in $1 c= Bound_Vars($1);
A1: for p,q,x,k for l being CQC-variable_list of k for P being
QC-pred_symbol of k holds P[VERUM] & P[P!l] & (P[p] implies P['not' p]) & (P[p]
