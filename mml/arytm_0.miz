theorem Th1:
 REAL+ c= REAL
proof
A1: REAL+ c= REAL+ \/ [:{{}},REAL+:] by XBOOLE_1:7;
     not [{},{}] in REAL+ by ARYTM_2:3;
 hence thesis by A1,NUMBERS:def 1,ZFMISC_1:40;
end;

theorem Th2:
 for x being Element of REAL+ st x <> {} holds [{},x] in REAL
proof let x be Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x <> {};
A2: now assume [{},x] in {[{},{}]};
     then [{},x] = [{},{}] by TARSKI:def 1;
    hence contradiction by A1,ZFMISC_1:33;
   end;
    {} in {{}} by TARSKI:def 1;
  then [{},x] in [:{{}},REAL+:] by ZFMISC_1:106;
  then [{},x] in REAL+ \/ [:{{}},REAL+:] by XBOOLE_0:def 2;
 hence [{},x] in REAL by A2,NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

theorem Th3:
 for y being set st [{},y] in REAL holds y <> {}
proof let y be set such that
A1: [{},y] in REAL and
A2: y = {};
     [{},y] in {[{},{}]} by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
 hence contradiction by A1,NUMBERS:def 1,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
end;

theorem Th4:
 for x,y being Element of REAL+ holds x - y in REAL
proof let x,y be Element of REAL+;
 per cases;
 suppose y <=' x;
  then x - y = x -' y by ARYTM_1:def 2;
  then x - y in REAL+;
 hence x - y in REAL by Th1;
 end;
 suppose
A1: not y <=' x;
  then A2: x - y = [{},y -' x] by ARYTM_1:def 2;
     y -' x <> {} by A1,ARYTM_1:9;
 hence x - y in REAL by A2,Th2;
end;
end;

theorem Th5:
 REAL+ misses [:{{}},REAL+:]
proof
 assume REAL+ meets [:{{}},REAL+:];
 then consider x being set such that
A1: x in REAL+ and
A2: x in [:{{}},REAL+:] by XBOOLE_0:3;
  consider x1,x2 being set such that
A3: x1 in {{}} and
A4: x2 in REAL+ & x = [x1,x2] by A2,ZFMISC_1:103;

theorem Th6:
 for x,y being Element of REAL+ st x - y = {} holds x = y
 proof let x,y be Element of REAL+;
A1: {} <> [{},y -' x];
  assume
A2: x - y = {};
   then A3:  y <=' x by A1,ARYTM_1:def 2;
   then x -' y = {} by A2,ARYTM_1:def 2;
  hence x = y by A3,ARYTM_1:10;

theorem Th7:
 not ex a,b being set st one = [a,b]
 proof let a,b be set;
  assume one = [a,b];
   then A1:  {{}} = {{a,b},{a}} by ORDINAL3:18,TARSKI:def 5;
      {a} in {{a,b},{a}} by TARSKI:def 2;
  hence contradiction by A1,TARSKI:def 1;
 end;

theorem Th8:
 for x,y,z being Element of REAL+ st x <> {} & x *' y = x *' z
   holds y = z
proof let x,y,z be Element of REAL+;
 assume that
A1: x <> {} and
A2: x *' y = x *' z;
 per cases;
 suppose
A3: z <=' y;
  then x *' (y -' z) = (x *' y) - (x *' z) by ARYTM_1:26
    .= {} by A2,ARYTM_1:18;
  then {} = y -' z by A1,ARYTM_1:2
    .= y - z by A3,ARYTM_1:def 2;
 hence y = z by Th6;
 end;
 suppose
A4: y <=' z;
  then x *' (z -' y) = x *' z - x *' y by ARYTM_1:26
      .= {} by A2,ARYTM_1:18;

theorem
   [*x,y*] in REAL implies y = 0
proof assume
A1: [*x,y*] in REAL;
  assume y <> 0;
  then [*x,y*] = (0,one) --> (x,y) by Def7;
  hence contradiction by A1,Th10;
end;

theorem
   for x,y being Element of REAL holds opp +(x,y) = +(opp x, opp y)
proof let x,y be Element of REAL;
     +(+(x,y),+(opp x, opp y))
         = +(x,+(y,+(opp x, opp y))) by Th25
