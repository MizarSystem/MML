proof
  let x be Element of REAL+ such that
A1: x <> {};

  for y being set st [{},y] in REAL holds y <> {}
proof
  let y be set such that
A1: [{},y] in REAL and

theorem Th4:
  for x,y being Element of REAL+ holds x - y in REAL
proof
  let x,y be Element of REAL+;
  per cases;
  suppose
    y <=' x;
    then x - y = x -' y by ARYTM_1:def 2;
    then x - y in REAL+;

theorem Th5:
  REAL+ misses [:{{}},REAL+:]
proof
  assume REAL+ meets [:{{}},REAL+:];
  then consider x being set such that

theorem Th8:
  for x,y,z being Element of REAL+ st x <> {} & x *' y = x *' z holds y = z
proof
  let x,y,z be Element of REAL+;

theorem
  [*x,y*] in REAL implies y = 0
proof
  assume
A1: [*x,y*] in REAL;
  assume y <> 0;
  then [*x,y*] = (0,1) --> (x,y) by Def7;
  hence contradiction by A1,Th10;
end;

theorem
  for x,y being Element of REAL holds opp +(x,y) = +(opp x, opp y)
proof
  let x,y be Element of REAL;
  +(+(x,y),+(opp x, opp y)) = +(x,+(y,+(opp x, opp y))) by Th25
