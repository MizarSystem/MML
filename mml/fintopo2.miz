reserve FT for non empty FT_Space_Str;
reserve A for Subset of FT;

theorem
     for FT being non empty FT_Space_Str,
      A,B being Subset of FT holds
    A c= B implies A^i c= B^i
proof
  let FT be non empty FT_Space_Str;
  let A,B be Subset of FT;
  assume A1:A c= B;
  let x be set;
  assume A2:x in A^i;
  then reconsider y=x as Element of FT;
  A3:U_FT y c= A by A2,FIN_TOPO:12;
         for t being Element of FT st t in U_FT y holds t in B
        proof
          let t be Element of FT;
          assume t in U_FT y;
          then t in A by A3;
          hence t in B by A1;
        end;
      then U_FT y c= B by SUBSET_1:7;
      hence thesis by FIN_TOPO:12;
end;

theorem Th2:
  A^delta = (A^b) /\ ((A^i)`)
proof
     for x being set holds x in A^delta iff x in (A^b) /\ ((A^i)`)
    proof
      let x be set;
      thus x in A^delta implies x in (A^b) /\ ((A^i)`)
        proof
          assume A1:x in A^delta;
          then reconsider y=x as Element of FT;
             U_FT y meets A & U_FT y meets A` by A1,FIN_TOPO:10;
          then y in (A^b) & y in ((A`)^b)`` by FIN_TOPO:13;
          then y in (A^b) & y in ((A^i)`) by FIN_TOPO:23;
          hence x in ((A^b) /\ ((A^i)`)) by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
        end;
      assume A2: x in ((A^b) /\ ((A^i)`));
      then reconsider y=x as Element of FT;

      then x in (A^b) & x in ((((A`)^b)`)`) by FIN_TOPO:23;
      then U_FT y meets A & U_FT y meets A` by FIN_TOPO:13;
      hence x in A^delta by FIN_TOPO:10;
    end;
  hence thesis by TARSKI:2;
end;

theorem
     A^delta = A^b \ A^i
proof
     for x being set holds x in A^delta iff x in A^b \ A^i
    proof
      let x be set;
      thus x in A^delta implies x in A^b \ A^i
      proof
        assume x in A^delta;
        then x in ((A^b) /\ ((A^i)`)) by Th2;
        hence thesis by SUBSET_1:32;
      end;
      assume x in A^b \ A^i;
      then x in ((A^b) /\ ((A^i)`)) by SUBSET_1:32;
