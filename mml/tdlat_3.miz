theorem
      Closed_Domains_Lattice X = Open_Domains_Lattice X implies
                                 X is extremally_disconnected
 proof
  assume Closed_Domains_Lattice X = Open_Domains_Lattice X;
         for A being Subset of X holds
      (A is open_condensed implies A is closed_condensed) &
         (A is closed_condensed implies A is open_condensed)
     proof
       let A be Subset of X;
      thus A is open_condensed implies A is closed_condensed
       proof
        assume A is open_condensed;
          then A in {E where E is Subset of X : E is open_condensed};
          then A in {E where E is Subset of X : E is closed_condensed};

theorem
      X is extremally_disconnected iff Domains_Lattice X is B_Lattice
 proof
  thus X is extremally_disconnected implies Domains_Lattice X is B_Lattice
   proof
    assume X is extremally_disconnected;
     then Domains_Lattice X = Open_Domains_Lattice X by Th46;
    hence thesis;
   end;
  assume Domains_Lattice X is B_Lattice;
  hence X is extremally_disconnected by Th51;
