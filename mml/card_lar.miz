theorem Th2:
   X is_club_in A iff

proof thus X is_club_in A implies X is closed unbounded
   proof
      assume X is_club_in A;

:: should be probably in ordinal2
theorem Th3:
  X c= sup X
proof let x be set such that A1: x in X;
   reconsider x1=x as Element of A by A1;
       x1 in sup X by A1,ORDINAL2:27;
   hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th4:
  (X is non empty &
  for B1 st B1 in X ex B2 st (B2 in X & B1 in B2) ) implies sup X is
  being_limit_ordinal infinite Ordinal
proof assume A1: X is non empty;
   assume A2: for B1 st B1 in X ex B2 st (B2 in X & B1 in B2);
   A3: for C st C in sup X holds succ C in sup X
   proof let C such that A4: C in sup X;
      consider B3 such that A5:  B3 in X and

  X is bounded iff ex B1 st B1 in A & X c= B1
proof
   A1: X c= sup X by Th3;
   A2: A = sup A by ORDINAL2:26;
   A3: X is bounded iff sup X <> A by Def4;
       sup X c< A iff sup X c= A & sup X <> A by XBOOLE_0:def 8;
   then sup X <> A iff sup X in A by A2,ORDINAL1:21,ORDINAL2:30;
   hence X is bounded implies ex B1 st B1 in A & X c= B1 by A1,Def4;
   given B1 such that A4: B1 in A and A5: X c= B1;
       sup X c= sup B1 by A5,ORDINAL2:30;

proof assume A1: not sup (X /\ B) = B;
   reconsider Y = (X /\ B) as Subset of B by XBOOLE_1:17;
       Y is bounded by A1,Def4;
   then consider B1 such that A2: B1 in B and A3: Y c= B1 by Th5;
   take B1;
   thus thesis by A2,A3;
end;

theorem Th7:
  X is unbounded iff for B1 st B1 in A ex C st C in X & B1 c= C
proof
   thus X is unbounded implies for B1 st B1 in A ex C st C in X & B1 c= C
   proof
      assume A1: X is unbounded;
      let B1 such that A2: B1 in A;

   end;
   assume A5: for B1 st B1 in A ex C st C in X & B1 c= C;
   assume X is bounded;
   then consider B1 such that A6: B1 in A and

   consider C such that A8: C in X and
   A9: B1 c= C by A5,A6;

proof assume A1: X is unbounded;

   A5: ex B3 being Element of A st B3 in LB by A1,A2,Th9;
       for x  being set st x in LB holds B1 in x
   proof let x be set;
      assume A6: x in LB;
