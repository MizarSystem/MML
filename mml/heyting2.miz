 reserve V, C, x, a, b for set;
 reserve A, B for Element of SubstitutionSet (V, C);

theorem
  for V, C being non empty set ex f be Element of PFuncs (V, C) st f <> {}
proof
 let V, C be non empty set;
 consider a be set such that A1: a in V by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
 consider b be set such that A2: b in C by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
 set f = {[a,b]};
    {a} c= V & {b} c= C by A1,A2,ZFMISC_1:37;
 then dom f c= V & rng f c= C by RELAT_1:23;
 then reconsider f as Element of PFuncs (V, C) by PARTFUN1:def 5;
    f <> {};
 hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for a, b being set st b in SubstitutionSet (V, C) & a in b holds
    a is finite Function
proof
  let a, b be set; assume
A1:  b in SubstitutionSet (V, C) & a in b;
  then b in { A where A is Element of Fin PFuncs (V,C) :
    ( for u being set st u in A holds u is finite ) &
      for s1, t being Element of PFuncs (V, C) holds
       ( s1 in A & t in A & s1 c= t implies s1 = t ) }
       by SUBSTLAT:def 1;
  then consider A being Element of Fin PFuncs (V,C) such that
A2:   A = b & ( for u being set st u in A holds u is finite ) &
      for s, t being Element of PFuncs (V, C) holds
       ( s in A & t in A & s c= t implies s = t );
     a is Element of PFuncs (V, C) by A1,SETWISEO:14;
  hence thesis by A1,A2;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for f being Element of PFuncs (V, C),
      g being set st g c= f holds g in PFuncs (V, C)
proof
  let f be Element of PFuncs (V, C),
      g be set;
  assume A1: g c= f;
  consider f1 be Function such that
A2:    f1 = f & dom f1 c= V & rng f1 c= C by PARTFUN1:def 5;
  reconsider g' = g as Function by A1,GRFUNC_1:6;
     dom g' c= dom f1 & rng g' c= rng f1 by A1,A2,RELAT_1:25;
  then dom g' c= V & rng g' c= C by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
  hence thesis by PARTFUN1:def 5;
end;

Lm1:
  for A, B, C be set st A = B \/ C & A c= B holds A = B
proof
  let A, B, C be set; assume
A1:   A = B \/ C & A c= B;
  then B c= A by XBOOLE_1:7;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

theorem Th4:
 PFuncs(V,C) c= bool [:V,C:]
  proof
   let x be set;
   assume x in PFuncs(V,C);
   then consider f being Function such that
A1:  x = f and
A2:  dom f c= V & rng f c= C by PARTFUN1:def 5;
A3: f c= [: dom f, rng f:] by RELAT_1:21;
       [:dom f, rng f:] c= [:V,C:] by A2,ZFMISC_1:119;
    then f c= [:V,C:] by A3,XBOOLE_1:1;
   hence x in bool [:V,C:] by A1;
  end;

theorem Th5:
  V is finite & C is finite implies PFuncs (V, C) is finite
proof
 A1: PFuncs(V,C) c= bool [:V,C:] by Th4;
  assume V is finite & C is finite;
   then [:V,C:] is finite by FINSET_1:19;
   then bool [:V,C:] is finite by FINSET_1:24;
  hence PFuncs(V,C) is finite by A1,FINSET_1:13;
end;

registration
  cluster functional finite non empty set;
  existence
  proof
    consider A, B be finite non empty set;
    take P = PFuncs(A,B);
    thus P is functional;
    thus P is finite by Th5;
    thus thesis;
  end;

theorem Th6:
  for a being finite Element of PFuncs (V, C) holds
    {a} in SubstitutionSet (V, C)
proof
 let a be finite Element of PFuncs (V, C);
A1: for u being set st u in {a} holds u is finite by TARSKI:def 1;
    for s, t being Element of PFuncs (V,C) holds
       ( s in { a } & t in { a } & s c= t implies s = t )
 proof
  let s, t be Element of PFuncs (V,C);
  assume s in { a } & t in { a } & s c= t;
  then s = a & t = a by TARSKI:def 1;
  hence s = t;
 end;
 then {.a.} in { A where A is Element of Fin PFuncs (V,C) :

proof
 assume A1: A ^ B = A;

       B c= PFuncs (V, C) & A c= PFuncs (V, C) by FINSUB_1:def 5;

A6: b1' tolerates b' by A5,PARTFUN1:135;
       b = b1 \/ b by A5,XBOOLE_1:12;

A12: a' = a' \/ b' by A9,XBOOLE_1:12;
       a' tolerates b' by A9,PARTFUN1:135;

       for b be finite set st b in A ^ B & b c= a holds b = a
    proof
      let b be finite set;
      assume A14: b in A ^ B & b c= a;
