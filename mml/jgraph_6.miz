 a<=(1-r)*a+r*b & (1-r)*a+r*b<=b
proof let a,b,r be real number;
 assume A1: 0<=r & r<=1 & a<=b;
  then A2: 1-r>=0 by SQUARE_1:12;
    r*a<=r*b by A1,AXIOMS:25;
  then (1-r)*a+r*a<=(1-r)*a+r*b by REAL_1:55;
  then ((1-r)+r)*a<=(1-r)*a+r*b by XCMPLX_1:8;
  then 1*a<=(1-r)*a+r*b by XCMPLX_1:27;
 hence a<=(1-r)*a+r*b;
    (1-r)*a<=(1-r)*b by A1,A2,AXIOMS:25;
  then (1-r)*a+r*b<=(1-r)*b+r*b by REAL_1:55;
  then ((1-r)+r)*b>=(1-r)*a+r*b by XCMPLX_1:8;
  then 1*b>=(1-r)*a+r*b by XCMPLX_1:27;
 hence (1-r)*a+r*b<=b;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for a,b being real number st a>=0 & b>0 or a>0 & b>=0 holds a+b>0
proof let a,b be real number;
 assume A1: a>=0 & b>0 or a>0 & b>=0;
    now per cases by A1;
  case a>=0 & b>0;
   hence a+b>0 by REAL_1:69;
  case a>0 & b>=0;
   hence a+b>0 by REAL_1:69;
  end;
 hence a+b>0;
end;

  then A4: sqrt(1+b^2)>=0 by SQUARE_1:def 4;
  A5: now per cases;
  case b>=0;

      (-b)^2>=0 by SQUARE_1:72;
    then (-b)^2*(1+a^2)>=0 by A2,SQUARE_1:19;
   hence (-b)*sqrt(1+a^2)<=sqrt(1+b^2) by A6,A7,SQUARE_1:94;
  end;
  then -((-b)*sqrt(1+a^2)) >= - sqrt(1+b^2) by REAL_1:50;
  then ((--b)*sqrt(1+a^2)) >= - sqrt(1+b^2) by XCMPLX_1:175;

theorem Th36: for Kb,Cb being Subset of TOP-REAL 2 st
 Kb={p: -1 <=p`1 & p`1<= 1 & -1 <=p`2 & p`2<= 1}&
 Cb={p2 where p2 is Point of TOP-REAL 2: |.p2.|<=1} holds Sq_Circ.:Kb=Cb
 proof let Kb,Cb be Subset of TOP-REAL 2;

theorem Th88: for p1,p2,p3,p4 being Point of TOP-REAL 2,
P,K being non empty compact Subset of TOP-REAL 2,
f being map of TOP-REAL 2,TOP-REAL 2 st
P= circle(0,0,1) & K=rectangle(-1,1,-1,1) & f=Sq_Circ
holds p1,p2,p3,p4 are_in_this_order_on K
  iff f.p1,f.p2,f.p3,f.p4 are_in_this_order_on P
proof let p1,p2,p3,p4 be Point of TOP-REAL 2,
P,K be non empty compact Subset of TOP-REAL 2,
f be map of TOP-REAL 2,TOP-REAL 2;
 assume A1: P= circle(0,0,1) & K=rectangle(-1,1,-1,1) & f=Sq_Circ;
  then A2: K is_simple_closed_curve by Th60;
    circle(0,0,1)={p5 where p5 is Point of TOP-REAL 2: |.p5.|=1}
                      by Th33;
  then A3: P is_simple_closed_curve by A1,JGRAPH_3:36;
 thus p1,p2,p3,p4 are_in_this_order_on K implies
  f.p1,f.p2,f.p3,f.p4 are_in_this_order_on P
