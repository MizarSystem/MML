theorem Th1:
 for B being Subset of X,
     C being Subset of X modified_with_respect_to D st
  B = C holds B is open implies C is open
 proof let B be Subset of X,
   C be Subset of X modified_with_respect_to D;
  assume A1: B = C;

         the topology of X modified_with_respect_to D =
            D-extension_of_the_topology_of X by TMAP_1:99,104;
  hence C is open by A1,A2,PRE_TOPC:def 5;

theorem
    for B being Subset of X,
     C being Subset of X modified_with_respect_to D st
  B = C holds B is closed implies C is closed
 proof let B be Subset of X,
   C be Subset of X modified_with_respect_to D;
  assume A1: B = C;
  assume B is closed;
   then A2:  B` is open by TOPS_1:29;
      the carrier of (X modified_with_respect_to D) = the carrier of X
      by TMAP_1:104;
    then C` is open by A1,A2,Th1;
  hence C is closed by TOPS_1:29;
 end;

theorem Th3:
 for C being Subset of X modified_with_respect_to  D` st C = D holds
  C is closed
 proof let C be Subset of X modified_with_respect_to  D`;

     then (Cl D) misses B & Cl D = [#]X by A2,TOPS_1:def 3,TSEP_1:40;
     then A7: (Cl D) /\ B = {} & Cl D = [#]X by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
   thus C is dense
    proof
     assume C is not dense;
      then Cl C <> [#](X modified_with_respect_to D) by TOPS_1:def 3;

 proof let C be Subset of X modified_with_respect_to  D`;
