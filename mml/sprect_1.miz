proof let A be trivial set;
 let B be set;
 assume
A1: B c= A;
 per cases by REALSET1:def 12;
 suppose A is empty;
 hence B is trivial by A1,XBOOLE_1:3;
 suppose ex x being set st A = {x};
 hence B is trivial by A1,ZFMISC_1:39;

definition
 cluster non constant -> non trivial Function;
 coherence
  proof let f be Function;
   assume f is non constant;
    then consider n1,n2 being set such that
A1:  n1 in dom f & n2 in dom f and
A2:  f.n1 <> f.n2 by SEQM_3:def 5;
      [n1,f.n1] in f & [n2,f.n2] in f by A1,FUNCT_1:8;
    then reconsider f as non empty Function;
      f is non trivial
     proof
      reconsider x = [n1,f.n1], y = [n2,f.n2] as Element of f by A1,FUNCT_1:8;
      take x,y;
      thus x <> y by A2,ZFMISC_1:33;

definition
 cluster trivial -> constant Function;
 coherence
  proof let f be Function such that
A1: f is trivial;
   assume f is not constant;
    then reconsider f as non constant Function;
      f is not trivial;
   hence contradiction by A1;
  end;

theorem Th2:
 for f being Function st rng f is trivial holds f is constant
proof let f be Function;
 assume
A1: rng f is trivial;
 per cases by A1,REALSET1:def 12;
 suppose rng f is empty;
  then reconsider f as empty Function by RELAT_1:64;
    f is trivial;
 hence thesis;
 suppose ex x being set st rng f = {x};
  then consider x being set such that
A2: rng f = {x};
    f = dom f --> x by A2,FUNCOP_1:15;
 hence f is constant;

definition let f be constant Function;
 cluster rng f -> trivial;
 coherence
  proof
    per cases;
    suppose f is empty;
     then reconsider g = f as empty Function;
      rng g is empty;
   hence rng f is trivial;
    suppose f <> {};

A1:   x in dom f by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
      for y being set holds
      y in {f.x} iff ex z being set st z in dom f & y = f.z
    proof let y be set;
      hereby assume
A2:      y in {f.x};
       take x;
       thus x in dom f & y = f.x by A1,A2,TARSKI:def 1;

     given z being set such that
A3:   z in dom f and
A4:   y = f.z;
        y = f.x by A1,A3,A4,SEQM_3:def 5;

proof let f,g be FinSequence;
 assume f^g is constant;
  then reconsider h = f^g as constant FinSequence;
    rng f c= rng h by FINSEQ_1:42;
  then rng f is trivial by Th1;
 hence f is constant by Th2;
    rng g c= rng h by FINSEQ_1:43;

  holds x = y
proof let x,y be set;
 assume <*x,y*> is constant;
  then reconsider s = <*x,y*> as constant Function;
A1: rng s is trivial;
A2: rng<*x,y*> = rng(<*x*>^<*y*>) by FINSEQ_1:def 9

theorem Th6:
 for GX being non empty TopSpace,
     A being Subset of GX,
     B being non empty Subset of GX
 holds A is_a_component_of B implies A <> {}
proof
 let GX be non empty TopSpace,
     A be Subset of GX,
     B be non empty Subset of GX;
 assume A is_a_component_of B;
  then consider B1 being Subset of GX|B such that

theorem Th7:
 for GX being TopStruct,
     A, B being Subset of GX
 holds A is_a_component_of B implies A c= B
proof
 let GX be TopStruct,
     A, B be Subset of GX;
 assume A is_a_component_of B;
  then consider B1 being Subset of GX|B such that
A1: B1 = A and
      B1 is_a_component_of GX|B by CONNSP_1:def 6;
    the carrier of GX|B = B by JORDAN1:1;
 hence A c= B by A1;

  st B1 is_a_component_of A & B2 is_a_component_of A &

proof
 let T be non empty TopSpace,
     A be non empty Subset of T,
     B1,B2,S be Subset of T such that
A1: B1 is_a_component_of A and
A2: B2 is_a_component_of A and
A3: S is_a_component_of A and
A4: B1 \/ B2 = A;
A5: S <> {} by A3,Th6;
    S c= A by A3,Th7;
  then S meets A by A5,XBOOLE_1:67;
  then S meets B1 or S meets B2 by A4,XBOOLE_1:70;
 hence S = B1 or S = B2 by A1,A2,A3,GOBOARD9:3;

     B1 \/ B2 = A & C1 \/ C2 = A
 holds { B1,B2 } = { C1,C2 }
proof
 let T be non empty TopSpace,
     A be non empty Subset of T,
     B1,B2,C1,C2 be Subset of T such that
A1: B1 is_a_component_of A and

A3: C1 is_a_component_of A and
A4: C2 is_a_component_of A and

    now let x be set;
      x = B1 or x = B2 iff x = C1 or x = C2 by A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6,Th8;
   hence x in { B1,B2 } iff x = C1 or x = C2 by TARSKI:def 2;
