theorem
     (A`)^delta = A^delta
proof
     for x being set holds x in (A`)^delta iff x in A^delta
    proof
      let x be set;
      thus x in (A`)^delta implies x in A^delta
        proof
          assume A1:x in (A`)^delta;
          then reconsider y=x as Element of FT;
             U_FT y meets (A`) & U_FT y meets (A`)` by A1,Th10;
          hence x in A^delta by Th10;
        end;
      assume A2:x in A^delta;
      then reconsider y=x as Element of FT;
         U_FT y meets (A`)` & U_FT y meets A` by A2,Th10;
      hence x in (A`)^delta by Th10;

theorem
     x in A^s implies not x in (A \ {x})^b
proof
  assume x in A^s;
  then A misses (U_FT x \ {x}) by Th14;
  then A /\ (U_FT x \ {x}) = {} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  then A1: (A /\ U_FT x) \ {x} = {} by XBOOLE_1:49;
     now per cases by A1,ZFMISC_1:66;
    suppose A /\ U_FT x = {};
then A2:    A misses U_FT x by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
         (A \ {x}) c= A by XBOOLE_1:36;
      hence (A \ {x}) misses U_FT x by A2,XBOOLE_1:63;
    end;
    suppose A /\ U_FT x = {x};
      then (U_FT x /\ A) \ {x} = {} by XBOOLE_1:37;
      then U_FT x /\ (A \ {x}) = {} by XBOOLE_1:49;
      hence (A \ {x}) misses U_FT x by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  end;
  end;
  hence thesis by Th13;

theorem
     A^s <> {} & Card A <> 1 implies A is not connected
proof
  assume A1:A^s <> {} & Card A <> 1;
  then consider z being Element of FT such that

  A3:z in A & (U_FT z \ {z}) misses A by A2,Th14;
  set B = A \ {z};
  set C = {z};
     {z} is Subset of A by A3,SUBSET_1:63;

A5:  Card {z} = 1 by CARD_1:50,CARD_2:20;
     A <> {} by A2,Th14;
  then A6:B <> {} by A1,A5,ZFMISC_1:66;
  A7:B misses C by XBOOLE_1:79;
     B^b misses C
    proof
      assume B^b meets C;
      then consider x being set such that
      A8:x in B^b & x in C by XBOOLE_0:3;
      reconsider x as Element of FT by A8;
         U_FT x meets B by A8,Th13;
      then consider y being set such that
        A9:y in U_FT x & y in B by XBOOLE_0:3;
      A10:x = z by A8,TARSKI:def 1;
      A11:B c= A by XBOOLE_1:36;
         not x in B by A8,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
      then y in U_FT x \ {x} by A9,ZFMISC_1:64;
      then (U_FT z \ {z}) meets B by A9,A10,XBOOLE_0:3;
      then consider w being set such that
        A12:w in (U_FT z \ {z}) /\ B by XBOOLE_0:4;
         (U_FT z \ {z}) /\ B c= (U_FT z \ {z}) /\ A by A11,XBOOLE_1:26;
      hence contradiction by A3,A12,XBOOLE_0:4;
