A46:  Cy <> D
      proof
        assume
        Cy = D;
        then
A47:    D \ Cy = {} by XBOOLE_1:37;
        Cy = {x,y} by A43,ENUMSET1:41;
        then not {}((TOP-REAL 2)|D) is connected by A2,A45,A44,A47,
        JORDAN6:60;
        hence thesis;
      end;
      {y} c= D;
      then Cy c= D by A2,XBOOLE_1:8;
      then
A48:  Cy c< D by A46,XBOOLE_0:def 8;
A49:  C c= Cy by XBOOLE_1:7;
      y in Y by TARSKI:def 1;
      then y in Cy by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      then Cy is non trivial by A45,A44,A49,REALSET1:14;
      then consider
      p1,p2 being Point of TOP-REAL 2, B being Subset of TOP-REAL 2
      such that
A50:  B is_an_arc_of p1,p2 and
A51:  Cy c= B and
A52:  B c= D by A3,A48;
      take p1, p2, B;
      thus B is_an_arc_of p1,p2 by A50;
      thus C c= B by A49,A51,XBOOLE_1:1;
      thus thesis by A52;
    end;
  end;
  suppose
    C is non trivial;
    hence thesis by A1,A31,A3;
  end;
end;
