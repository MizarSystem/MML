begin  :: Preliminaries

reserve x,y,X for set,
        i,j,k,m,n for Nat,
        p for FinSequence of X,
        ii for Integer;

theorem Th1:
 for p being FinSequence,x being set holds not x in rng p & p is one-to-one
 iff p^<*x*> is one-to-one
proof
    let p be FinSequence,x be set;
A1: rng p misses rng <*x*> & p is one-to-one & <*x*> is one-to-one
    iff p ^ <*x*> is one-to-one by FINSEQ_3:98;
       rng <*x*> = {x} by FINSEQ_1:55;
    hence thesis by A1,FINSEQ_3:102,ZFMISC_1:54,56;
end;

theorem Th2:
  1 <= ii & ii <= len p implies p.ii in X
proof assume A1:1 <= ii & ii <= len p;
  then 0 <= ii;
  then reconsider ii as Nat by INT_1:16;
     ii in dom p by A1,FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by PARTFUN1:27;
end;

theorem Th3:
  1 <= ii & ii <= len p implies p/.ii = p.ii
proof assume A1:1 <= ii & ii <= len p;
  then 0 <= ii;
  then reconsider ii as Nat by INT_1:16;
     ii in dom p by A1,FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by FINSEQ_4:def 4;
end;

reserve G for Graph,
        pe,qe for FinSequence of the Edges of G,
        p,q for oriented Chain of G,
        W for Function,
        U,V,e,ee for set,
        v1,v2,v3,v4 for Vertex of G;

theorem Th4:
  W is_weight_of G & len pe = 1 implies cost(pe,W) = W.(pe.1)
proof
     assume A1: W is_weight_of G & len pe = 1;
     set f=RealSequence(pe,W);
A2:  dom f = dom pe & for i st i in dom pe holds f.i=W.(pe.i)

A3:  1 in dom pe by A1,FINSEQ_3:27;
        len f=1 by A1,A2,FINSEQ_3:31;
then A4:  f = <*f.1*> by FINSEQ_1:57;
     thus cost(pe,W) = Sum f by GRAPH_5:def 16
     .= f.1 by A4,RVSUM_1:103
     .= W.(pe.1) by A1,A3,GRAPH_5:def 15;
end;

theorem Th5:
  e in the Edges of G implies <*e*> is Simple (oriented Chain of G)
proof
   assume e in the Edges of G;
then A1:  <*e*> is FinSequence of the Edges of G by SCMFSA_7:22;
      len <*e*> = 1 by FINSEQ_1:57;
   hence thesis by A1,GRAPH_5:18;
end;

Lm1:
 for p,q being FinSequence st 1 <= n & n <= len p holds p.n = (p^q).n
proof
  let p,q be FinSequence;
  assume 1 <= n & n <= len p;
  then n in dom p by FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence p.n = (p^q).n by FINSEQ_1:def 7;
end;

Lm2:
for p,q being FinSequence st 1 <= n & n <= len q holds
  q.n = (p^q).(len p+n)
proof
  let p,q be FinSequence;
  assume 1 <= n & n <= len q;
  then n in dom q by FINSEQ_3:27;

       thus p is_simple_vertex_seq_at g,i,n by A35;
       thus P is_oriented_edge_seq_of p by A35;
       thus P is_shortestpath_of v1,v2,W by A27,A30,A34,A35,Th16;
       thus cost(P,W)=g.(2*n+i) by A35;
     end;
     thus thesis by A27,A30,A34,Th11;
