begin  :: Preliminaries

reserve x,y,X for set,
  i,j,k,m,n for Element of NAT,
  p for FinSequence of X,
  ii for Integer;

theorem Th1:
  for p being FinSequence,x being set holds not x in rng p & p is
  one-to-one iff p^<*x*> is one-to-one
proof
  let p be FinSequence,x be set;
A1: rng <*x*> = {x} by FINSEQ_1:55;
  rng p misses rng <*x*> & p is one-to-one & <*x*> is one-to-one iff p ^
  <*x*> is one-to-one by FINSEQ_3:98;
  hence thesis by A1,FINSEQ_3:102,ZFMISC_1:54,56;
end;

theorem Th2:
  1 <= ii & ii <= len p implies p.ii in X
proof
  assume that
A1: 1 <= ii and
A2: ii <= len p;
  reconsider ii as Element of NAT by A1,INT_1:16;
  ii in dom p by A1,A2,FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by PARTFUN1:27;
end;

theorem Th3:
  1 <= ii & ii <= len p implies p/.ii = p.ii
proof
  assume that
A1: 1 <= ii and
A2: ii <= len p;
  reconsider ii as Element of NAT by A1,INT_1:16;
  ii in dom p by A1,A2,FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by PARTFUN1:def 8;
end;

reserve G for Graph,
  pe,qe for FinSequence of the carrier' of G,
  p,q for
  oriented Chain of G,
  W for Function,
  U,V,e,ee for set,
  v1,v2,v3,v4 for Vertex
  of G;

theorem Th4:
  W is_weight_of G & len pe = 1 implies cost(pe,W) = W.(pe.1)
proof
  assume that
A1: W is_weight_of G and
A2: len pe = 1;
A3: 1 in dom pe by A2,FINSEQ_3:27;
  set f=RealSequence(pe,W);

  then len f=1 by A2,FINSEQ_3:31;
  then
A4: f = <*f.1*> by FINSEQ_1:57;
  thus cost(pe,W) = Sum f by GRAPH_5:def 16
    .= f.1 by A4,FINSOP_1:12
    .= W.(pe.1) by A1,A3,GRAPH_5:def 15;
end;

theorem Th5:
  e in the carrier' of G implies <*e*> is Simple (oriented Chain of
  G)
proof
  assume
  e in the carrier' of G;
  then
A1: <*e*> is FinSequence of the carrier' of G by FINSEQ_1:95;
  len <*e*> = 1 by FINSEQ_1:57;
  hence thesis by A1,GRAPH_5:18;
end;

Lm1: for n be Nat for p,q being FinSequence st 1 <= n & n <= len p holds p.n =
(p^q).n

proof
  let n be Nat;
  let p,q be FinSequence;
  assume
  1 <= n & n <= len p;
  then n in dom p by FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by FINSEQ_1:def 7;
end;

Lm2: for p,q being FinSequence st 1 <= n & n <= len q holds q.n = (p^q).(len p
+n)

proof
  let p,q be FinSequence;
