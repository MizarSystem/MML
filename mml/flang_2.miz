:: Preliminaries - Numbers:

theorem Th1:
  m + k <= i & i <= n + k implies ex mn st mn + k = i & m <= mn & mn <= n
proof
  assume that
A1: m + k <= i and
A2: i <= n + k;
  m + k <= m + i by A1,XREAL_1:38;
  then k <= i by XREAL_1:6;
  then reconsider mn = i - k as Nat by NAT_1:21;
  take mn;
  thus mn + k = i;
  m + k <= mn + k by A1;
  hence thesis by A2,XREAL_1:6;
end;

theorem Th2:
  m <= n & k <= l & m + k <= i & i <= n + l implies ex mn, kl st mn
  + kl = i & m <= mn & mn <= n & k <= kl & kl <= l
proof
  assume that

A2: k <= l and
A3: m + k <= i and
A4: i <= n + l;
  per cases;
  suppose
    i <= n + k;
    then consider mn such that
A5: mn + k = i & m <= mn & mn <= n by A3,Th1;
    take mn, k;
    thus mn + k = i & m <= mn & mn <= n by A5;
    thus thesis by A2;

    then consider kl such that
A6: kl + n = i and
A7: k <= kl & kl <= l by A4,Th1;
    take n, kl;
    thus n + kl = i & m <= n & n <= n by A1,A6;
    thus thesis by A7;
  end;

theorem Th3:
  m < n implies ex k st m + k = n & k > 0

theorem
  A? |^ (m, n) c= A*
proof
  per cases;
  suppose

theorem
  A c= B? implies B? = (B \/ A)?
proof
  assume
