                  thus thesis by A5,FUNCT_1:34;
             end;
            thus the carrier of X1 c= f.:the carrier of X1
             proof
                  let z be set;
                  assume
    A6:           z in the carrier of X1;
                     the carrier of X1 c= the carrier of A by VECTSP_4:def 2;
                  then reconsider z as Element of A by A6;
                     f.z = z by FUNCT_1:34;
                  hence thesis by A6,FUNCT_2:43;
             end;
          end;
         hence thesis by A2,A3,VECTSP_7:16;
       end;
      hence thesis by A1,FUNCT_1:34;
    end;
