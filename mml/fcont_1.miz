theorem
   f is_continuous_in x0 iff x0 in dom f & for s1 st rng s1 c= dom f &
s1 is convergent & lim s1=x0 & (for n holds s1.n<>x0) holds
f*s1 is convergent & f.x0=lim(f*s1)
proof
thus f is_continuous_in x0 implies x0 in dom f & for s1 st rng s1 c= dom f &
 s1 is convergent & lim s1=x0 & (for n holds s1.n<>x0) holds
 f*s1 is convergent & f.x0=lim(f*s1) by Def1;
assume A1: x0 in dom f & for s1 st rng s1 c=dom f &
s1 is convergent & lim s1=x0
 & (for n holds s1.n<>x0) holds f*s1 is convergent & f.x0=lim(f*s1);
hence x0 in dom f;
let s2 such that A2: rng s2 c=dom f & s2 is convergent & lim s2=x0;
   now per cases;
suppose ex n st for m st n<=m holds s2.m=x0;
 then consider N be Nat such that A3: for m st N<=m holds s2.m=x0;
 A4: for n holds (s2^\N).n=x0
 proof let n;
     N<=n+N by NAT_1:37; then s2.(n+N)=x0 by A3;
  hence (s2^\N).n=x0 by SEQM_3:def 9;
 end;
    s2^\N is subsequence of s2 by SEQM_3:47;
 then rng (s2^\N) c= rng s2 by RFUNCT_2:11;
 then A5: rng (s2^\N) c= dom f by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
 A6: now let p be real number such that A7: p>0;
  take n=0; let m such that n<=m;
     abs((f*(s2^\N)).m-f.x0)=abs(f.((s2^\N).m)-f.x0) by A5,RFUNCT_2:21
  .=abs(f.x0-f.x0) by A4
  .=0 by ABSVALUE:7;
  hence abs((f*(s2^\N)).m-f.x0)<p by A7;
 end;
 then A8: f*(s2^\N) is convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
    f*(s2^\N)=(f*s2)^\N by A2,RFUNCT_2:22;
 then f*s2 is convergent & f.x0=lim((f*s2)^\N) by A6,A8,SEQ_2:def 7,SEQ_4:35;
 hence thesis by SEQ_4:33;
end;
suppose A9: for n ex m st n<=m & s2.m<>x0;
 then consider m1 be Nat such that A10: 0<=m1 & s2.m1<>x0;

 A11: ex m st P[m] by A10;
 consider M be Element of NAT such that
 A12: P[M] & for n st P[n] holds M<=n from NAT_1:sch 5(A11);
 A13: now let n; consider m such that A14: n+1<=m & s2.m<>x0 by A9;
  take m; thus n<m & s2.m<>x0 by A14,NAT_1:38;
 end;
 defpred P[Nat,set,set] means for n,m st $2=n & $3=m holds
 n<m & s2.m<>x0 & for k st n<k & s2.k<>x0 holds m<=k;
 A15: for n for x be Element of NAT ex y be Element of NAT st P[n,x,y]
 proof let n; let x be Element of NAT;
  defpred P[Nat] means x<$1 & s2.$1<>x0;
  A16: ex m st P[m] by A13;
  consider l be Nat such that A17: P[l] &
   for k st P[k] holds l<=k from NAT_1:sch 5(A16);
  take l; thus thesis by A17;
 end;
 reconsider M' = M as Element of NAT;
 consider F be Function of NAT,NAT such that
 A18: F.0=M' & for n be Element of NAT holds P[n,F.n,F.(n+1)]
   from RECDEF_1:sch 2(A15);
 A19: dom F=NAT & rng F c= NAT by FUNCT_2:def 1;
    rng F c= REAL by XBOOLE_1:1;
 then reconsider F as Real_Sequence by A19,FUNCT_2:def 1,RELSET_1:11;
 A20: now let n;  F.n in rng F by A19,FUNCT_1:def 5;hence F.n is Nat by A19;
 end;
    now let n;  F.n is Nat & F.(n+1) is Nat by A20;
  hence F.n<F.(n+1) by A18;
 end;
 then reconsider F as increasing Seq_of_Nat by A19,SEQM_3:def 8,def 11;
A21: for n st s2.n<>x0 ex m st F.m=n
 proof
  defpred P[Nat] means s2.$1<>x0 & for m holds F.m<>$1;
  assume
A22: ex n st P[n];
  consider M1 be Nat such that A23: P[M1] &
  for n st P[n] holds M1<=n from NAT_1:sch 5(A22);
  defpred P[Nat] means $1<M1 & s2.$1<>x0 & ex m st F.m=$1;
  A24: ex n st P[n]
  proof take M;
   A25: M<=M1 by A12,A23;
       M <> M1 by A18,A23;
   hence M<M1 by A25,REAL_1:def 5;
   thus s2.M<>x0 by A12;
   take 0; thus thesis by A18;
  end;
  A26: for n st P[n] holds n<=M1;
  consider MX be Nat such that A27: P[MX] &
  for n st P[n] holds n<=MX from NAT_1:sch 6(A26,A24);
  A28: for k st MX<k & k<M1 holds s2.k=x0
  proof given k such that A29: MX<k & k<M1 & s2.k<>x0;
      now per cases;
   suppose ex m st F.m=k; hence contradiction by A27,A29;
   end;
   suppose for m holds F.m<>k; hence contradiction by A23,A29;
   end;
   end; hence contradiction;
  end;
  consider m such that A30: F.m=MX by A27;
  A31: MX<F.(m+1) & s2.(F.(m+1))<>x0 &
      for k st MX<k & s2.k<>x0 holds F.(m+1)<=k by A18,A30;
  A32: F.(m+1)<=M1 by A18,A23,A27,A30;
     now assume F.(m+1)<>M1; then F.(m+1)<M1 by A32,REAL_1:def 5;
hence contradiction by A28,A31;
  end;hence contradiction by A23;
 end;
A33: for n holds (s2*F).n<>x0
 proof
  defpred P[Nat] means (s2*F).$1<>x0;
  A34: P[0] by A12,A18,SEQM_3:31;
  A35: for k st P[k] holds P[k+1]
  proof let k such that (s2*F).k<>x0;
      P[k,F.k,F.(k+1)] by A18; then s2.(F.(k+1))<>x0;
   hence (s2*F).(k+1)<>x0 by SEQM_3:31;
  end;
  thus for n holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A34,A35);
 end;
 A36: s2*F is subsequence of s2 by SEQM_3:def 10;
then A37: s2*F is convergent by A2,SEQ_4:29;
    rng (s2*F) c= rng s2 by A36,RFUNCT_2:11;
then A38: rng (s2*F) c= dom f by A2,XBOOLE_1:1;
    lim (s2*F)=x0 by A2,A36,SEQ_4:30;
 then A39: f*(s2*F) is convergent & f.x0=lim(f*(s2*F)) by A1,A33,A37,A38;
A40: now let p be real number; assume A41: 0<p;
  then consider n such that
  A42: for m st n<=m holds abs((f*(s2*F)).m-f.x0)<p by A39,SEQ_2:def 7;
  take k=F.n; let m such that A43: k<=m;
     now per cases;
  suppose A44: s2.m=x0;
      abs((f*s2).m-f.x0)=abs(f.(s2.m)-f.x0) by A2,RFUNCT_2:21
     .= abs(f.x0-f.x0) by A44 .=0 by ABSVALUE:7;
   hence abs((f*s2).m-f.x0)<p by A41;
  end;
  suppose s2.m<>x0; then consider l be Nat such that A45: m=F.l by A21;
      n<=l by A43,A45,SEQM_3:7;
   then abs((f*(s2*F)).l-f.x0)<p by A42;
   then abs(f.((s2*F).l)-f.x0)<p by A38,RFUNCT_2:21;
   then abs(f.(s2.m)-f.x0)<p by A45,SEQM_3:31;
   hence abs((f*s2).m-f.x0)<p by A2,RFUNCT_2:21;
  end;
  end; hence abs((f*s2).m-f.x0)<p;
 end;
 hence f*s2 is convergent by SEQ_2:def 6;
 hence f.x0=lim(f*s2) by A40,SEQ_2:def 7;
 end;
 end; hence thesis;
