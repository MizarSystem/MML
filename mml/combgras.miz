  k,n for Element of NAT,
  x,y,X,Y,Z for set;

theorem Th1:
  for a,b being set st a <> b & card a = n & card b = n holds card
  (a /\ b) in n & n + 1 c= card (a \/ b)
proof
  let a,b be set;
  assume that
A1: a <> b and
A2: card a = n and
A3: card b = n and
A4: not card (a /\ b) in n or not n + 1 c= card (a \/ b);
  n c= card (a /\ b) or card (a \/ b) in n + 1 by A4,ORDINAL1:26;
  then n c= card (a /\ b) or card (a \/ b) in succ n by NAT_1:39;
  then
A5: n c= card (a /\ b) or card (a \/ b) c= n by ORDINAL1:34;
  n c= card(a \/ b) & card(a /\ b) c= n by A2,CARD_1:27,XBOOLE_1:7,17;
  then
A6: card a = card (a /\ b) & card (a /\ b) = card b or card (a \/ b) = card
  a & card (a \/ b) = card b by A2,A3,A5, XBOOLE_0:def 10;
A7: a c= a \/ b & b c= a \/ b by XBOOLE_1:7;
  a is finite set & b is finite set by A2,A3;
  then a = a /\ b & b = a /\ b or a = a \/ b & b = a \/ b by A7,A6,
  CARD_FIN:1,XBOOLE_1:17;
  hence contradiction by A1;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for a,b being set st card a = n + k & card b = n + k holds card(a
  /\ b) = n iff card(a \/ b) = n + 2*k
proof
  let a,b be set;
  assume that
A1: card a = n + k and
A2: card b = n + k;
A3: a is finite by A1;
A4: b is finite by A2;
  thus card(a /\ b) = n implies card(a \/ b) = n + 2*k
  proof
    assume card(a /\ b) = n;
    then card(a \/ b) = n + k + (n + k) - n by A1,A2,A3,A4,CARD_2:64;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  thus card (a \/ b) = n + 2*k implies card (a /\ b) = n
  proof
    reconsider m = card (a /\ b) as Nat by A3;
    assume card(a \/ b) = n + 2*k;
    then n + 2*k = n + k + (n + k) - m by A1,A2,A3,A4,CARD_2:64;
    hence thesis;
  end;
end;

theorem Th3:
  card X c= card Y iff ex f being Function st f is one-to-one & X
  c= dom f & f.:X c= Y
proof
  thus card X c= card Y implies ex f being Function st f is one-to-one & X c=
  dom f & f.:X c= Y
  proof
    assume card X c= card Y;
    then consider f being Function such that
A1: f is one-to-one & dom f = X & rng f c= Y by CARD_1:26;
    take f;
    thus thesis by A1,RELAT_1:146;
  end;
  given f being Function such that
A2: f is one-to-one and
A3: X c= dom f and
A4: f.:X c= Y;
A5: rng(f|X) c= Y
  proof
    let y;
    assume y in rng(f|X);
    then consider x such that
A6: x in dom(f|X) & y = (f|X).x by FUNCT_1:def 5;
    x in X & y = f.x by A3,A6,FUNCT_1:70,RELAT_1:91;
    then y in f.:X by A3,FUNCT_1:def 12;
    hence thesis by A4;
  end;
  f|X is one-to-one & dom(f|X) = X by A2,A3,FUNCT_1:84,RELAT_1:91;
  hence thesis by A5,CARD_1:26;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for f being Function st f is one-to-one & X c= dom f holds card(f
  .:X) = card X
proof
  let f be Function;
  assume f is one-to-one & X c= dom f;
  then card(f.:X) c= card X & card X c= card(f.:X) by Th3,CARD_2:3;
  hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

theorem Th5:
  X \ Y = X \ Z & Y c= X & Z c= X implies Y = Z
proof
  assume that
A1: X \ Y = X \ Z and
A2: Y c= X and
A3: Z c= X;
  Z \/ X = X by A3,XBOOLE_1:12;
  then
A4: Y \ Z c= X by A2,XBOOLE_1:43;
  X \ Z misses Y by A1,XBOOLE_1:106;
  then Y \ Z = {} by A4,XBOOLE_1:67,81;
  then
A5: Y c= Z by XBOOLE_1:37;
  Y \/ X = X by A2,XBOOLE_1:12;
  then
A6: Z \ Y c= X by A3,XBOOLE_1:43;
  X \ Y misses Z by A1,XBOOLE_1:106;
  then Z \ Y = {} by A6,XBOOLE_1:67,81;
  then Z c= Y by XBOOLE_1:37;
  hence thesis by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

theorem Th6:
  for Y being non empty set for p being Function of X,Y st p is
  one-to-one for x1,x2 being Subset of X holds x1 <> x2 implies p.:x1 <> p.:x2
proof
  let Y be non empty set;
  let p be Function of X,Y such that
A1: p is one-to-one;
  let x1 be Subset of X;
  let x2 be Subset of X;
A2: X = dom p by FUNCT_2:def 1;
A3: not x1 c= x2 implies p.:x1 <> p.:x2
  proof
    assume not x1 c= x2;
    then consider a being set such that
A4: a in x1 and
A5: not a in x2 by TARSKI:def 3;
    not p.a in p.:x2
    proof
      assume p.a in p.:x2;
      then ex b being set st b in dom p & b in x2 & p.a = p.b by FUNCT_1:
      def 12;
      hence contradiction by A1,A2,A4,A5,FUNCT_1:def 8;
    end;
    hence thesis by A2,A4,FUNCT_1:def 12;
  end;
A6: not x2 c= x1 implies p.:x1 <> p.:x2
  proof
    assume not x2 c= x1;
    then consider a being set such that
A7: a in x2 and
A8: not a in x1 by TARSKI:def 3;
    not p.a in p.:x1
    proof
      assume p.a in p.:x1;
      then ex b being set st b in dom p & b in x1 & p.a = p.b by FUNCT_1:
      def 12;
      hence contradiction by A1,A2,A7,A8,FUNCT_1:def 8;
