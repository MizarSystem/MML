theorem Th1:
  for n be (Element of NAT), p be FinSequence holds 1 <= n & n <
  len p iff n in dom p & n+1 in dom p
proof
  let n be Element of NAT;
  let p be FinSequence;
  thus 1 <= n & n < len p implies n in dom p & n+1 in dom p
  proof
    assume that
A1: 1 <= n and

  proof
    assume that
A4: n in dom p and

  let A,B be Equivalence_Relation of Y;
  assume that
A1: a = A and
A2: b = B;
