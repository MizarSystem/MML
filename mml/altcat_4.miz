theorem
     AllIso AllCoretr C = AllIso C
  proof
A1: the carrier of AllIso AllCoretr C = the carrier of AllCoretr C by Def5;
A2: the carrier of AllIso C = the carrier of C by Def5;
A3: the carrier of AllCoretr C = the carrier of C by Def4;
A4: AllIso C is non empty subcategory of AllCoretr C by Th42;
         now
      let i be set; assume

      thus (the Arrows of AllIso AllCoretr C).i =
