  existence
  proof
    defpred P[set,set] means ex Y,Z st $1 = Y & $2 = Z & Y c= Z;
    consider R such that
A1: [x,y] in R iff x in X & y in X & P[x,y] from RELAT_1:sch 1;
    take R;
    thus field R = X
    proof
      thus x in field R implies x in X
      proof
A2:     now
          assume
          x in dom R;
          then ex y st [x,y] in R by RELAT_1:def 4;

    thus [Y,Z] in R implies Y c= Z
    proof

  uniqueness
  proof
    let R1,R2 be Relation such that

A6: for Y,Z st Y in X & Z in X holds [Y,Z] in R1 iff Y c= Z and
A7: field R2 = X and
A8: for Y,Z st Y in X & Z in X holds [Y,Z] in R2 iff Y c= Z;
    let x,y;
    thus [x,y] in R1 implies [x,y] in R2
    proof
      assume
A9:   [x,y] in R1;
      then
