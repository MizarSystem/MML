A1:    [x,y] in R iff x in X & y in X & P[x,y] from RELAT_1:sch 1;
     take R;
     thus field R = X
       proof
        thus x in field R implies x in X
          proof assume A2: x in field R;
A3:          now assume x in dom R;
              then ex y st [x,y] in R by RELAT_1:def 4;

     let Y,Z such that
A4:    Y in X & Z in X;
     thus [Y,Z] in R implies Y c= Z

 R1 iff Y c= Z and
A6:   field R2 = X & for Y,Z st Y in X & Z in X holds [Y,Z] in R2 iff Y c= Z;
     let x,y;
     thus [x,y] in R1 implies [x,y] in R2
       proof assume
A7:       [x,y] in R1;
then A8:       x in field R1 & y in field R1 by RELAT_1:30;
