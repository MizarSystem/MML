theorem Th2: sqrt(r1^2+r2^2)<=abs(r1)+abs(r2)
proof
  A1: r1^2>=0 by XREAL_1:65;
      r2^2>=0 by XREAL_1:65;
  then r1^2+r2^2>=0+0 by A1,XREAL_1:9;
  then A2:(sqrt(r1^2+r2^2))^2=r1^2+r2^2 by SQUARE_1:def 4;
A3:(abs(r1)+abs(r2))^2=(abs(r1))^2+2*(abs(r1))*(abs(r2))+(abs(r2))^2;
      (abs(r1))^2=r1^2 by COMPLEX1:161;

  then A6: 2*abs(r1)>=0 by XREAL_1:129;
  A7:abs(r2)>=0 by COMPLEX1:132;
  then 2*abs(r1)*abs(r2)>=0 by A6,XREAL_1:129;
  then A8:(abs(r1)+abs(r2))^2>= (sqrt(r1^2+r2^2))^2 by A4,REAL_2:105;
      (sqrt(r1^2+r2^2))^2>=0 by XREAL_1:65;
  then A9:sqrt((abs(r1)+abs(r2))^2)>=sqrt((sqrt(r1^2+r2^2))^2) by A8,
SQUARE_1:94;
      abs(r1)+abs(r2)>=0+0 by A5,A7,XREAL_1:9;

theorem Th3: abs(r1)<=sqrt(r1^2+r2^2) & abs(r2)<=sqrt(r1^2+r2^2)
 proof
   A1: r1^2>=0 by XREAL_1:65;
   A2:r2^2>=0 by XREAL_1:65;
   then r1^2+0<= r1^2+r2^2 by XREAL_1:8;
   then sqrt(r1^2)<= sqrt(r1^2+r2^2) by A1,SQUARE_1:94;
  hence abs(r1)<= sqrt(r1^2+r2^2) by COMPLEX1:158;
       0+r2^2<= r1^2+r2^2 by A1,XREAL_1:9;
   then sqrt(r2^2)<= sqrt(r1^2+r2^2) by A2,SQUARE_1:94;
