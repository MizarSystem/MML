  then n + k >= m by A3,XXREAL_0:2;
  then dist((seq1.(n + k)), (seq2.(n + k))) < r by A2;
  then dist((seq1 ^\k).n, (seq2.(n + k))) < r by NAT_1:def 3;

theorem
  seq is bounded implies (seq ^\k) is bounded by Th31;

theorem

theorem
  X is complete & seq is Cauchy implies seq is bounded
proof
  assume
  X is complete & seq is Cauchy;
  then seq is convergent by Def6;
  hence thesis by Th24;
