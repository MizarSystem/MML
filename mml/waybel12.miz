  proof
    let L be non empty RelStr,
        f be Function of NAT, the carrier of L,
        n be Nat;
    set A = {f.m where m is Nat: m <= n};
        0 <= n by NAT_1:18;
then A1: f.0 in A;
A2: A c= {f.m where m is Nat: m in {0} \/ Seg n}
    proof
      let q be set;
      assume q in A;
      then consider m being Nat such that
A3:     q = f.m and
A4:     m <= n;
A5:   Seg m c= Seg n by A4,FINSEQ_1:7;
          m = 0 or m in Seg m by FINSEQ_1:5;
      then m in {0} or m in Seg n by A5,TARSKI:def 1;
      then m in {0} \/ Seg n by XBOOLE_0:def 2;
      hence q in {f.k where k is Nat: k in {0} \/ Seg n} by A3;

        Card {F(m) where m is Nat: m in {0} \/ Seg n} <=` Card ({0} \/ Seg n)

        A c= the carrier of L
    proof
      let q be set;
      assume q in A;

      consider Y being set such that
A15:     Y in F by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 1;
