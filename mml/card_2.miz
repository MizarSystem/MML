Lm6: for Z being finite set holds Z <> {} &
(for X,Y st X in Z & Y in Z holds X c= Y or Y c= X) implies union Z in Z
proof
  let Z be finite set;
A1: card Z = card Z;
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means
  for Z being finite set st card Z = $1 & Z <> {} &
  (for X,Y st X in Z & Y in Z holds X c= Y or Y c= X) holds union Z in Z;
A2: P[0];
A3: for k be Element of NAT st P[k] holds P[k+1] by Lm5;
  for n holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A2,A3);
  hence thesis by A1;

theorem
  Z <> {} & Z is finite &
  (for X,Y st X in Z & Y in Z holds X c= Y or Y c= X) implies union Z in Z

theorem
  x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 are_mutually_different implies card {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} = 5
proof
  assume x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 are_mutually_different;
  then x1 <> x2 & x1 <> x3 & x1 <> x4 & x1 <> x5 & x2 <> x3 &
  x2 <> x4 & x2 <> x5 & x3 <> x4 & x3 <> x5 & x4 <> x5 by ZFMISC_1:def 7;
  then card {x1,x2,x3,x4} = 4 & not x5 in {x1,x2,x3,x4} &
  {x1,x2,x3,x4} is finite & {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} = {x1,x2,x3,x4} \/ {x5}

  hence card {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} = 4+1 by Th54

theorem
  for M1, M2 being set st card M1 = 0 & card M2 = 0 holds M1 = M2
proof
  let M1, M2 be set;
  assume card M1 = {} & card M2 = {};
   then M1 = {} & M2 = {};
  hence thesis;
