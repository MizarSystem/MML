begin :: Preliminaries

reserve p, q for Point of TOP-REAL 2,
  r for Real,
  h for non constant standard special_circular_sequence,
  g for FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
  f for non empty FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
  I, i1, i, j, k for Element of NAT;

canceled 2;

theorem Th3:
  for n be Element of NAT, h be FinSequence of TOP-REAL n st len h
  >= 2 holds h/.len h in LSeg(h,len h-'1)
proof
  let n be Element of NAT;
  let h be FinSequence of TOP-REAL n;
  set i = len h;
  assume
A1: len h >= 2;
  then
A2: 2-1 <= i-1 by XREAL_1:11;
  i-'1+1 = len h by A1,XREAL_1:237,XXREAL_0:2;
  hence thesis by A2,TOPREAL1:27;
end;

theorem Th4:
  3 <= i implies i mod (i-'1) = 1
proof
  assume
A1: 3 <= i;
  then
A2: i-'1 = i-1 by XREAL_1:235,XXREAL_0:2;
  3-'1 = 2+1-'1 .= 2 by NAT_D:34;
  then 2 <= i-'1 by A1,NAT_D:42;
  then 1 < i-1 by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
  then 1+i < (i-1)+i by XREAL_1:10;
  then 1+i-1 < (i-1)+i-1 by XREAL_1:16;
  then
A3: i < (i-1) + (i-1);
  i-'1 <= i by NAT_D:35;
  hence i mod (i-'1) = i - (i-1) by A2,A3,JORDAN4:7
    .= 1;
end;

theorem Th5:
  p in rng h implies ex i be Element of NAT st 1 <= i & i+1 <= len h & h.i = p
proof
A1: 4 < len h by GOBOARD7:36;
A2: 1 < len h by GOBOARD7:36,XXREAL_0:2;
  assume p in rng h;
  then consider x be set such that
A3: x in dom h and
A4: p = h.x by FUNCT_1:def 5;
  reconsider i = x as Element of NAT by A3;
A5: 1 <= i by A3,FINSEQ_3:27;
  set j = S_Drop (i,h);
A6: i <= len h by A3,FINSEQ_3:27;
  1 <= j & j+1 <= len h & h.j = p
  proof
A7: i <= len h -' 1 + 1 by A5,A6,XREAL_1:237,XXREAL_0:2;
    per cases by A7,NAT_1:8;
    suppose
A8:   i <= len h-'1;
      then j = i by A5,JORDAN4:34;
      then j + 1 <= len h -' 1 + 1 by A8,XREAL_1:9;
      hence thesis by A4,A5,A2,A8,JORDAN4:34,XREAL_1:237;
    end;
    suppose
A9:   i = len h-'1+1;
      then i = len h by A1,XREAL_1:237,XXREAL_0:2;
      then i mod (len h -'1) = 1 by A1,Th4,XXREAL_0:2;
      then
A10:  j = 1 by JORDAN4:def 1;
A11:  1 <= len h by GOBOARD7:36,XXREAL_0:2;
      then
A12:  len h in dom h by FINSEQ_3:27;
      1 in dom h by A11,FINSEQ_3:27;
      then h.1 = h/.1 by PARTFUN1:def 8
        .= h/.len h by FINSEQ_6:def 1
        .= h.len h by A12,PARTFUN1:def 8;
      hence thesis by A4,A1,A9,A10,XREAL_1:237,XXREAL_0:2;
    end;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th6:
  for g being FinSequence of REAL st r in rng g holds Incr g.1 <= r
  & r <= Incr g.len Incr g
proof
  let g be FinSequence of REAL;
  assume r in rng g;
  then r in rng Incr g by SEQ_4:def 25;
  then consider x being set such that
A1: x in dom Incr g and
A2: Incr g.x=r by FUNCT_1:def 5;
  reconsider j=x as Element of NAT by A1;
A3: x in Seg len Incr g by A1,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  then
A4: j <= len Incr g by FINSEQ_1:3;
A5: 1 <= j by A3,FINSEQ_1:3;
  then
A6: 1 <= len Incr g by A4,XXREAL_0:2;
  then 1 in dom Incr g by FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence Incr g.1 <= r by A1,A2,A5,SEQ_4:154;
  len Incr g in dom Incr g by A6,FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by A1,A2,A4,SEQ_4:154;
