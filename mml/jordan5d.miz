begin :: Preliminaries

 reserve p, q for Point of TOP-REAL 2,
         r for Real,
         h for non constant standard special_circular_sequence,
         g for FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
         f for non empty FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
         I, i1, i, j, k for Nat;

canceled 2;

theorem Th3:
 for n be Nat,
     h be FinSequence of TOP-REAL n st len h >= 2 holds
  h/.len h in LSeg(h,len h-'1)
proof
 let n be Nat;
 let h be FinSequence of TOP-REAL n;
 set i = len h;
 assume A1: len h >= 2;
 then i >= 1 by XXREAL_0:2;
 then A2: i-'1+1 = len h by BINARITH:53;
    2-1 <= i-1 by A1,XREAL_1:11;
 then 1 <= i-'1 by JORDAN3:1;
 hence h/.i in LSeg(h,i-'1) by A2,TOPREAL1:27;
end;

theorem Th4:
  3 <= i implies i mod (i-'1) = 1
proof
A1: 3-'1 = 2+1-'1
       .= 2 by BINARITH:39;
   assume A2: 3 <= i;
   then 1 <= i by XXREAL_0:2;
then A3: i-'1 = i-1 by BINARITH:50;
A4: 2 <= i-'1 by A1,A2,JORDAN3:5;
then A5: 0 < i-'1;
A6: i-'1 <= i by BINARITH:52;
      1 < i-1 by A3,A4,XXREAL_0:2;
   then 1+i < (i-1)+i by XREAL_1:10;
   then 1+i-1 < (i-1)+i-1 by REAL_1:92;
   then i < (i-1) + (i-1);
   hence i mod (i-'1) = i - (i-1) by A3,A5,A6,JORDAN4:7
              .= 1;
end;

theorem Th5:
  p in rng h implies ex i be Nat st 1 <= i & i+1 <= len h & h.i = p
  proof
    assume p in rng h;
    then consider x be set such that
A1:    x in dom h & p = h.x by FUNCT_1:def 5;
    reconsider i = x as Nat by A1;
    set j = S_Drop (i,h);
A2: 1 <= i & i <= len h by A1,FINSEQ_3:27;
A3: 4 < len h by GOBOARD7:36;
then A4: 3 <= len h by XXREAL_0:2;
A5:  1 < len h & 1+1 <= len h by A3,XXREAL_0:2;
       1 <= j & j+1 <= len h & h.j = p
    proof
A6:   i <= len h -' 1 + 1 by A2,A5,BINARITH:53;
      per cases by A6,NAT_1:26;
      suppose A7: i <= len h-'1;
      then j = i by A2,JORDAN4:34;
      then j + 1 <= len h -' 1 + 1 by A7,XREAL_1:9;
      hence thesis by A1,A2,A5,A7,BINARITH:53,JORDAN4:34;
      end;
      suppose A8: i = len h-'1+1;
then i = len h by A5,BINARITH:53;
      then i mod (len h -'1) = 1 by A4,Th4;
then A9:   j = 1 by JORDAN4:def 1;
         1 <= len h & len h <= len h by A3,XXREAL_0:2;
then A10:    1 in dom h & len h in dom h by FINSEQ_3:27;
      then h.1 = h/.1 by FINSEQ_4:def 4
         .= h/.len h by FINSEQ_6:def 1
         .= h.len h by A10,FINSEQ_4:def 4;
      hence thesis by A1,A5,A8,A9,BINARITH:53;
    end;
    end;
    hence thesis;
  end;

theorem Th6:
  for g being FinSequence of REAL st r in rng g holds
    Incr g.1 <= r & r <= Incr g.len Incr g
proof let g be FinSequence of REAL;
 assume r in rng g; then r in rng Incr g by GOBOARD2:def 2;
  then consider x being set such that
  A1: x in dom Incr g & Incr g.x=r by FUNCT_1:def 5;
  A2: x in Seg len Incr g by A1,FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  reconsider j=x as Nat by A1;
  A3:1 <= j & j <= len Incr g by A2,FINSEQ_1:3;
then A4: 1 <= len Incr g by XXREAL_0:2;
  then 1 in dom Incr g by FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence Incr g.1 <= r by A1,A3,GOBOARD2:18;
     len Incr g in dom Incr g by A4,FINSEQ_3:27;
  hence thesis by A1,A3,GOBOARD2:18;
