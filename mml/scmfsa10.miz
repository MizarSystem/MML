set S = SCM+FSA;

reserve a, b, d1, d2, d3, d4 for Int-Location,
        A, B for Data-Location,
        f, f1, f2, f3 for FinSeq-Location,
        il, i1, i2 for Instruction-Location of SCM+FSA,
        L for Instruction-Location of SCM,
        I for Instruction of SCM+FSA,
        s for State of SCM+FSA,
        T for InsType of SCM+FSA,
        k for natural number;

theorem Th1:
 for f being Function, a, A, b, B, c, C being set st a <> b & a <> c holds
  ( f +* (a .--> A) +* (b .--> B) +* (c .--> C) ).a = A
  proof
    let f be Function,
        a, A, b, B, c, C be set such that
A1:   a <> b & a <> c;
    thus ( f +* (a .--> A) +* (b .--> B) +* (c .--> C) ).a
       = ( f +* (a .--> A) ).a by A1,SCMBSORT:6
      .= A by YELLOW14:3;
  end;

theorem Th2:
 for a, b being set holds <*a*> +* (1,b) = <*b*>
  proof
    let a, b be set;
A1: dom <*a*> = {1} by FINSEQ_1:4,def 8;
    then 1 in dom <*a*> by TARSKI:def 1;
then A2: <*a*> +* (1,b) = <*a*> +* (1 .--> b) by FUNCT_7:def 3;
then A3: dom (<*a*> +* (1,b))
       = dom <*a*> \/ dom (1 .--> b) by FUNCT_4:def 1
      .= {1} \/ {1} by A1,CQC_LANG:5
      .= {1};
A4: dom <*b*> = {1} by FINSEQ_1:4,def 8;
      for x being set st x in {1} holds (<*a*> +* (1,b)).x = <*b*>.x
    proof
      let x be set;
      assume x in {1};
then A5:   x = 1 by TARSKI:def 1;
      hence (<*a*> +* (1,b)).x = b by A2,YELLOW14:3
        .= <*b*>.x by A5,FINSEQ_1:def 8;
    end;
    hence thesis by A3,A4,FUNCT_1:9;
  end;

definition
  let la, lb be Int-Location,
      a, b be Integer;
 redefine func (la,lb) --> (a,b) -> FinPartState of SCM+FSA;

      o in Int-Locations \/ FinSeq-Locations \/ {IC SCM+FSA} or
     o in the Instruction-Locations of SCM+FSA by SCMFSA_2:8,XBOOLE_0:def 2;
    then o in Int-Locations \/ FinSeq-Locations or o in {IC SCM+FSA} or
      o in the Instruction-Locations of SCM+FSA by XBOOLE_0:def 2;
    then o in Int-Locations or o in FinSeq-Locations or o in {IC SCM+FSA} or
