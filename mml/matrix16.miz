Lm1: for k being Nat st k <= n & k >= 1 holds k-1 mod n=k-1
proof
  let k be Nat;
  assume that
A1: k <= n and
A2: k >= 1;
A3: k-1>=1-1 by A2,XREAL_1:11;
A4: n-1 < n by XREAL_1:46;
  k-1 <= n-1 by A1,XREAL_1:11;
  then k-1 < n by A4,XXREAL_0:2;
  hence thesis by A3,INT_3:10;
end;

Lm2: for n,i,j be Nat st i in Seg n & j in Seg n holds (j-i mod n)+1 in Seg n
proof
  let n,i,j be Nat;
  assume that

  n-1 < n by XREAL_1:46;
  then

  j-i mod n <=n-1
  proof
    per cases;
    suppose
      0 <=j-i;
      hence thesis by A4,A6,INT_3:10;
    end;
    suppose
A7:   0 >j-i;
      then j-i<=-1 by INT_1:21;
      then n+(j-i)<=n+-1 by XREAL_1:8;

  then (j-i mod n)+1>=0+1 & (j-i mod n)+1 in NAT by INT_1:16,XREAL_1:8;
  hence thesis by A8;
end;

Lm3: for n,i,j be Nat holds ([i,j] in [:Seg n, Seg n:] or [j,i] in [:Seg n,
Seg n:]) implies (j-i mod n)+1 in Seg n
proof
  let n,i,j be Nat;
  assume [i,j] in [:Seg n, Seg n:] or [j,i] in [:Seg n, Seg n:];
