begin    :: Preliminaries

 reserve i,j,k,n for natural number;
 reserve x,x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,y1,y2,y3 for set;

definition let x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 be set;
  pred x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 are_mutually_different means :Def1:
  x1 <> x2 & x1 <> x3 & x1 <> x4 & x1 <> x5 & x2 <> x3 &
  x2 <> x4 & x2 <> x5 & x3 <> x4 & x3 <> x5 & x4 <> x5;
end;

theorem
        x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 are_mutually_different
   implies card {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} = 5
  proof
   assume x1,x2,x3,x4,x5 are_mutually_different;
   then x1 <> x2 & x1 <> x3 & x1 <> x4 & x1 <> x5 & x2 <> x3 &
      x2 <> x4 & x2 <> x5 & x3 <> x4 & x3 <> x5 & x4 <> x5 by Def1;
   then card {x1,x2,x3,x4} = 4 & not x5 in {x1,x2,x3,x4} &
      {x1,x2,x3,x4} is finite & {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} = {x1,x2,x3,x4} \/ {x5}
      by CARD_2:78,ENUMSET1:18,50;
   hence card {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5} = 4+1 by CARD_2:54 .= 5;
  end;

theorem Th2:
   4 = {0,1,2,3}
proof
  set x = {i where i is Nat: i < 4};
A1: x c= {0,1,2,3}
  proof
   let y be set;
   assume y in x;
   then consider i being Nat such that
A2: y=i & i < 3+1;
        i <= 3 by A2,NAT_1:38;
   then i = 0 or i=1 or i=2 or i=3 by CQC_THE1:4;
   hence y in {0,1,2,3} by A2,ENUMSET1:19;
  end;
A3: {0,1,2,3} c= x
    proof
     let y be set;
     assume y in {0,1,2,3};
     then y=0 or y=1 or y=2 or y=3 by ENUMSET1:18;
     hence y in x;
    end;
  thus 4 = x by AXIOMS:30
  .= {0,1,2,3} by A1,A3,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
