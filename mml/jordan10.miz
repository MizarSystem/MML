end;

theorem Th5:
  C misses L~Cage(C,n)
proof
  set f = Cage(C,n), G = Gauge(C,n);
  assume
  not thesis;
  then consider c being set such that
A1: c in C and
A2: c in L~f by XBOOLE_0:3;
  L~f = union { LSeg(f,i) where i is Element of NAT: 1 <= i & i+1 <= len f
  } by TOPREAL1:def 6;
  then consider Z being set such that
A3: c in Z and
A4: Z in { LSeg(f,i) where i is Element of NAT: 1 <= i & i+1 <= len f }
  by A2,TARSKI:def 4;
  consider i being Element of NAT such that
A5: Z = LSeg(f,i) and
A6: 1 <= i & i+1 <= len f by A4;
  f is_sequence_on G by JORDAN9:def 1;
  then LSeg(f,i) = left_cell(f,i,G) /\ right_cell(f,i,G) by A6,GOBRD13:30;
  then
A7: c in left_cell(f,i,G) by A3,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
  left_cell(f,i,G) misses C by A6,JORDAN9:33;
  hence contradiction by A1,A7,XBOOLE_0:3;
end;

theorem Th6:
  N-bound L~Cage(C,n) = N-bound C + (N-bound C - S-bound C)/(2|^n)
proof
  set a = N-bound C, s = S-bound C, w = W-bound C, f = Cage(C,n), G = Gauge(C,
  n);
  consider i such that
A1: 1 <= i and
A2: i+1 <= len G and
A3: f/.1 = G*(i,width G) and
  f/.2 = G*(i+1,width G) and
  N-min C in cell(G,i,width G-'1) and
  N-min C <> G*(i,width G-'1) by JORDAN9:def 1;
A4: len G = width G by JORDAN8:def 1;
  4 <= len G by JORDAN8:13;
  then
A5: 1 <= len G by XXREAL_0:2;
  i+0 <= i+1 by XREAL_1:8;
  then i <= len G by A2,XXREAL_0:2;
  then
A6: [i,len G] in Indices G by A1,A4,A5,MATRIX_1:37;
A7: 2|^n <> 0 by NEWTON:102;

    .= s+(a-s)+(a-s)/(2|^n) by A7,XCMPLX_1:88
    .= a+(a-s)/(2|^n);
end;

theorem Th7:
  i < j implies N-bound L~Cage(C,j) < N-bound L~Cage(C,i)
proof
  assume
A1: i < j;
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means i < $1 implies N-bound L~Cage(C,$1) <
  N-bound L~Cage(C,i);
A2: for n being Element of NAT st P[n] holds P[n+1]
  proof
    let n be Element of NAT;
    assume
A3: P[n];
    set j = n + 1, a = N-bound C, s = S-bound C;
A4: a+(a-s)/(2|^j) - (a+(a-s)/(2|^n)) = 0 + (a-s)/(2|^j) - (a-s)/(2|^n)

      .= (a-s - (2*a-2*s))/(2|^n*2) by XCMPLX_1:121
      .= (s-a)/(2|^n*2);
    2|^n > 0 by NEWTON:102;
    then
A5: 2|^n*2 > 0 * 2 by XREAL_1:70;
A6: N-bound L~Cage(C,n) = a+(a-s)/(2|^n) & N-bound L~Cage(C,j) = a+(a-s)/(
    2|^j) by Th6;
    s - a < 0 by SPRECT_1:34,XREAL_1:51;
    then 0 > a+(a-s)/(2|^j) - (a+(a-s)/(2|^n)) by A5,A4,XREAL_1:143;
    then
A7: N-bound L~Cage(C,n+1) < N-bound L~Cage(C,n) by A6,XREAL_1:50;
    assume
    i < n+1;
    then i <= n by NAT_1:13;
    hence thesis by A3,A7,XXREAL_0:1,2;
  end;
A8: P[0] by NAT_1:2;
  for n being Element of NAT holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A8,A2);

proof
  thus meet BDD-Family C c= C \/ BDD C
  proof
    let x be set;
    assume
A1: x in meet BDD-Family C;
    COMPLEMENT UBD-Family C = BDD-Family C by Th20;
    then
    ([#] the carrier of TOP-REAL 2) \ union UBD-Family C = meet BDD-Family
    C by SETFAM_1:47;
    then not x in union UBD-Family C by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 5;
    then
A2: not x in UBD C by Th14;
    per cases;
    suppose
A3:   not x in C;
A4:   BDD C \/ UBD C = C` by JORDAN2C:31;
      x in C` by A1,A3,SUBSET_1:50;
      then x in BDD C by A2,A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    end;
    suppose
      x in C;
      hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    end;
  end;
  (BDD C) misses (UBD C) by JORDAN2C:28;
  then
A5: (BDD C) /\ (UBD C) = {} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
A6: BDD C c= meet BDD-Family C
  proof
    let x be set;
    assume
A7: x in BDD C;
    then not x in UBD C by A5,XBOOLE_0:def 4;
    then
A8: not x in union UBD-Family C by Th14;
    for Y being set st Y in BDD-Family C holds x in Y
    proof
      let Y be set;
      assume

      then consider n such that

      not contradiction;
