theorem
  for G1, G2 being Group for f being Homomorphism of G1, G2 st f is
  one-to-one holds FuncLatt f is Homomorphism of lattice G1, lattice G2
proof
  let G1, G2 be Group;
  let f be Homomorphism of G1, G2;
  assume
  f is one-to-one;
  then
A1: FuncLatt f is Semilattice-Homomorphism of lattice G1, lattice G2 by
  Th36;
  FuncLatt f is sup-Semilattice-Homomorphism of lattice G1, lattice G2 by
  Th37;
  hence thesis by A1,VECTSP_8:11;
