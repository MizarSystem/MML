theorem Th51: :: Theorem 9
  A is 1st_class implies Int Cl A = Int Cl Int A & Cl Int A = Cl Int Cl A
proof
  Cl Int A c= Cl A by PRE_TOPC:49,TOPS_1:44;
  then
A1: Int Cl Int A c= Int Cl A by TOPS_1:48;
  Int A c= Int Cl A by PRE_TOPC:48,TOPS_1:48;
  then
A2: Cl Int A c= Cl Int Cl A by PRE_TOPC:49;
  assume A is 1st_class;
  then
A3: Int Cl A c= Cl Int A by Def6;
  then
A4: Cl Int Cl A c= Cl Cl Int A by PRE_TOPC:49;
  Int Int Cl A c= Int Cl Int A by A3,TOPS_1:48;

theorem Th52: :: Theorem 9

proof

  per cases by A1;
  suppose
A2: Int Cl A = Int Cl Int A;
    Int Cl Int A c= Cl Int A by TOPS_1:44;

theorem Th53: :: Theorem 10
  A is 1st_class & B is 1st_class implies Int Cl A /\ Int Cl B =

proof
  assume that

A2: B is 1st_class;
A3: Cl Int B = Cl Int Cl B by A2,Th51;
  Cl Int A = Cl Int Cl A by A1,Th51;

A8: Int Cl B = Int Cl Int B by A2,Th51;
  Cl Int (A /\ B) c= Cl (A /\ B) by PRE_TOPC:49,TOPS_1:44;
  then
A9: Int Cl Int (A /\ B) c= Int Cl (A /\ B) by TOPS_1:48;
  Int Cl A = Int Cl Int A by A1,Th51;
  then Int Cl A /\ Int Cl B = Int Cl Int (A /\ B) by A8,Th1;
  hence thesis by A5,A9,A7,A4,A6,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
