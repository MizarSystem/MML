 proof assume A1: c in dom f & f/.c in SD;
  then c in dom f & (f qua Function).c in SD by FINSEQ_4:def 4;
  then [c,(f qua Function).c] in (SD|f) by GRFUNC_1:67;
  hence thesis by A1,FINSEQ_4:def 4;

 assume [c,f/.c] in (SD|f);
 then c in dom (SD|f) by FUNCT_1:8;

theorem
   c in f"SD iff [c,f/.c] in f & f/.c in SD
proof
thus c in f"SD implies [c,f/.c] in f & f/.c in SD
 proof assume c in f"SD;
then A1: [c,(f qua Function).c] in f & (f qua Function).c in SD
      by GRFUNC_1:87;
  then c in dom f by FUNCT_1:8;
  hence thesis by A1,FINSEQ_4:def 4;
 end;
 assume A2: [c,f/.c] in f & f/.c in SD;
 then c in dom f by Th65;
 hence thesis by A2,Th44;

theorem Th76:
 f is_constant_on X iff
  ex d st for c st c in X /\ dom f holds f.c = d
 proof
  hereby assume f is_constant_on X;
   then consider d such that
A1:   for c st c in X /\ dom f holds f/.c = d by Def3;
   take d;
   let c;
   assume
A2:   c in X /\ dom f;
   then c in dom f by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
   hence f.c = f/.c by FINSEQ_4:def 4 .= d by A1,A2;
  end;
  given d such that
A3:   for c st c in X /\ dom f holds f.c = d;
  take d;
  let c;
  assume
A4:   c in X /\ dom f;
  then c in dom f by XBOOLE_0:def 3;
  hence f/.c = f.c by FINSEQ_4:def 4 .= d by A3,A4;
 end;

theorem
   f is_constant_on X iff
 for c1,c2 st c1 in X /\ dom f & c2 in X /\ dom f holds f.c1=f.c2
proof
thus f is_constant_on X implies
     for c1,c2 st c1 in X /\ dom f & c2 in X /\ dom f holds f.c1=f.c2
 proof assume f is_constant_on X;
  then consider d such that
A1: for c st c in X /\ dom f holds f.c = d by Th76;
  let c1,c2; assume c1 in X /\ dom f & c2 in X /\ dom f;
  then f.c1 = d & f.c2 = d by A1;
  hence thesis;
 end;
 assume A2: for c1,c2 st c1 in X /\ dom f & c2 in X /\ dom f holds f.c1=f.c2;
    now per cases;
  suppose A3: X /\ dom f = {};
      now consider d being Element of D;
    take d; let c;
    thus c in X /\ dom f implies f.c = d by A3;
   end;
   hence thesis by Th76;
  end;
  suppose A4: X /\ dom f <> {};
   consider x being Element of X /\ dom f;
      now let c;
    assume
A5:  c in X /\ dom f;
A6:  x in dom f by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
    hence f.c = f.x by A2,A5 .= f/.x by A6,FINSEQ_4:def 4;
   end;
  hence thesis by Th76;
 end;
 end;
 hence thesis;
end;

theorem
     d in f.:X implies ex c st c in dom f & c in X & d = f.c
proof
 assume d in f.:X;
 then consider x such that
A1: x in dom f & x in X & d = (f qua Function).x by FUNCT_1:def 12;
 reconsider x as Element of C by A1;
 take x;
 thus thesis by A1;
end;

theorem
   f is one-to-one implies (d in rng f & c = (f").d iff c in dom f & d = f.c)
proof assume
A1: f is one-to-one;
     f" = (f qua Function)";
 hence thesis by A1,FUNCT_1:54;
