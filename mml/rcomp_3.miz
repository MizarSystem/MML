  coherence
  proof
    let T be SubSpace of RealSpace;
    the carrier of T is Subset of RealSpace by TOPMETR:def 1;
    hence the carrier of T is real-membered;
  end;

theorem Th1:
  for X being non empty bounded_below real-membered set, Y being
  closed Subset of REAL st X c= Y holds lower_bound X in Y
proof
  let X be non empty bounded_below real-membered set;
  let Y be closed Subset of REAL;
  assume

  reconsider X as non empty bounded_below Subset of REAL by MEMBERED:3;

theorem Th3:
  for X, Y being Subset of REAL holds Cl(X \/ Y) = Cl X \/ Cl Y
proof
  let X, Y be Subset of REAL;
  reconsider A = X, B = Y as Subset of R^1 by TOPMETR:17;
