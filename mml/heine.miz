reserve p,q,w for Real;

theorem Th1: for A being SubSpace of RealSpace, p,q being Point of A
 st x = p & y = q holds dist(p,q) = abs( x - y )
  proof
   let A be SubSpace of RealSpace, p,q be Point of A;
    assume A1: x = p & y = q;
A2: x is Real & y is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
    thus dist(p,q) = (the distance of A).(p,q) by METRIC_1:def 1
            .= (real_dist).(x, y) by A1,METRIC_1:def 14,TOPMETR:def 1
            .= abs( x - y ) by A2,METRIC_1:def 13;
  end;

theorem Th2: x <= y & y <= z implies [. x,y .] \/ [. y,z .] = [. x,z .]
  proof
   assume A1: x <= y & y <= z;
   A2: [. x,y .] \/ [. y,z .] = [. x,y .] \/ {q:y<=q & q<=z} by RCOMP_1:def 1
        .= {p: x <= p & p <= y} \/ {q: y <= q & q <= z} by RCOMP_1:def 1;
          now let o be set;
   A3: now assume A4: o in {p: x <= p & p <= y} \/ {q: y <= q & q <= z};
           now per cases by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 2;
        suppose o in {p: x <= p & p <= y};
         then consider a be Real such that A5: o=a & x <= a & a <= y;
               x <= a & a <= z by A1,A5,AXIOMS:22;
         hence o in {w: x <= w & w <= z} by A5;
        end;
        suppose o in {p: y <= p & p <= z};
         then consider a be Real such that A6: o=a & y <= a & a <= z;
              x <= a & a <= z by A1,A6,AXIOMS:22;
         hence o in {w: x <= w & w <= z} by A6;
        end;
        end;
       hence o in {w: x <= w & w <= z};
      end;
          now assume o in {w: x <= w & w <= z};
       then consider r be Real such that A7: o=r & x <= r & r <= z;
           x <= r & r <= y & r <= z or x <= r & y <= r & r <= z by A7;
       then o in {p: x <= p & p <= y} or o in {q: y <= q & q <= z} by A7;
       hence o in {p: x <= p & p <= y} \/ {q: y <= q & q <= z} by
XBOOLE_0:def 2;
      end;
     hence o in {p: x <= p & p <= y} \/ {q: y <= q & q <= z} iff
      o in {w: x <= w & w <= z} by A3;
     end;
     then {p: x <= p & p <= y} \/ {q: y <= q & q <= z} = {w: x <= w & w <= z}
      by TARSKI:2;
     hence thesis by A2,RCOMP_1:def 1;
  end;

theorem Th3: x >= 0 & a + x <= b implies a <= b
 proof
  assume A1: x >= 0 & a + x <= b;
  then a + x - x <= b - x by REAL_1:49;
  then a <= b - x & b - x <= b by A1,REAL_2:173;
  hence thesis by AXIOMS:22;
 end;

theorem Th4: x >= 0 & a - x >= b implies a >= b
 proof
  assume A1: x >= 0 & a - x >= b;
   then a - x + x >= b + x by AXIOMS:24;
   then a >= b + x & b + x >= b by A1,REAL_2:173;
  hence thesis by AXIOMS:22;
 end;

theorem Th5: x > 0 implies x|^k > 0
 proof
  defpred P[Nat] means for x st x > 0 holds x|^$1 > 0;
  A1: P[0]
   proof
    let x;   x|^0 = 1 by NEWTON:9;
    hence thesis;
    end;
  A2: for k holds P[k] implies P[k+1]
    proof
     let k such that A3: for x st x > 0 holds x|^k > 0;
     let x; assume x > 0;
     then x > 0 & x|^k > 0 & x|^(k+1) = x * x|^k by A3,NEWTON:11;
     hence thesis by REAL_2:122;
    end;
      for k holds P[k] from NAT_1:sch 1(A1,A2);
  hence thesis;
 end;

reserve seq for Real_Sequence;

theorem Th6:
 seq is increasing & rng seq c= NAT implies n <= seq.n
 proof
  defpred P[Nat] means $1 <= seq.$1;
  assume that A1: seq is increasing and A2: rng seq c= NAT;
       0 in NAT;
   then 0 in dom seq by FUNCT_2:def 1;
   then seq.0 in rng seq by FUNCT_1:def 5;
   then seq.0 is natural by A2,ORDINAL2:def 21;
then A3: P[0] by NAT_1:18;
A4: for k st P[k] holds P[k+1]
    proof
     let k such that A5: k <= seq.k;
          k+1 in NAT;
      then k+1 in dom seq by FUNCT_2:def 1;
      then seq.(k+1) in rng seq by FUNCT_1:def 5;
      then reconsider k' = seq.(k+1) as Nat by A2;
          seq.k < seq.(k+1) by A1,SEQM_3:def 11;
      then k < k' by A5,AXIOMS:22;
      hence k+1 <= seq.(k+1) by NAT_1:38;
    end;
       for n holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A3,A4);
   hence thesis;
 end;

definition let seq,k;
 func k to_power seq -> Real_Sequence means
  :Def1: for n holds it.n = k to_power (seq.n);
 existence
  proof
   deffunc F(Nat) = k to_power (seq.$1);
   thus ex s being Real_Sequence st for n holds
   s.n = F(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
  end;
 uniqueness
  proof
   let s1,s2 be Real_Sequence;
   assume that A1: for n holds s1.n = k to_power (seq.n) and
               A2: for n holds s2.n = k to_power (seq.n);
        now let n; thus s1.n = k to_power (seq.n) by A1 .= s2.n by A2; end;
    hence thesis by FUNCT_2:113;
  end;
end;

  defpred P[Nat] means 2|^$1 >= $1 + 1;
  Lm1: P[0] by NEWTON:9;
  Lm2: for n st P[n] holds P[n+1]
      proof
       let n; assume 2|^n >= n+1;
        then 2|^n - n >= 1 & 2 >= 0 by REAL_1:84;
        then A1: 2*(2|^n - n) >= 2*1 by AXIOMS:25;
             2|^(n+1) - (n + 1 + 1) = 2*2|^n - (2*n - n + 2) by NEWTON:11
             .= 2*(2|^n - n) + (n - 2);
         then 2|^(n+1) - (n + 1 + 1) >= 2 + (n - 2) by A1,AXIOMS:24;
         then 2|^(n+1) - (n + 1 + 1) >= n & n >= 0 by NAT_1:18;
         then 2|^(n+1) >= 0 + (n + 1 + 1) by REAL_1:84;
        hence 2|^(n+1) >= n + 1 + 1;
      end;

theorem Th7:
  2|^n >= n + 1
   proof for n holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(Lm1,Lm2); hence thesis; end;

theorem Th8:
  2|^n > n
 proof
      2|^n >= n + 1 & n+1 > n by Th7,NAT_1:38;
  hence thesis by AXIOMS:22;
 end;

theorem
Th9: seq is divergent_to+infty implies 2 to_power seq is divergent_to+infty
 proof
  assume A1: seq is divergent_to+infty;
  let r be Real;
   consider p being Nat such that A2: p > r by SEQ_4:10;
   consider n such that A3: for m st n <= m holds p < seq.m by A1,
LIMFUNC1:def 4;
    take n; let m; assume m >= n;
     then p < seq.m & 2 > 1 & 2<>0 by A3;
     then 2 to_power p < 2 to_power (seq.m) & 2 to_power p = 2|^p & 2|^p > p
      by Th8,POWER:44,48;
     then p < 2 to_power (seq.m) by AXIOMS:22;
     then r < 2 to_power (seq.m) by A2,AXIOMS:22;
    hence r < (2 to_power seq).m by Def1;
 end;

theorem Th10:
 for T being TopSpace st the carrier of T is finite holds T is compact
  proof
   let T be TopSpace;
   assume A1: the carrier of T is finite;
   let F be Subset-Family of T such that
   A2: F is_a_cover_of T & F is open;
   reconsider F' = F as Subset-Family of T;
   take F';
   thus F' c= F & F' is_a_cover_of T by A2;
       bool(the carrier of T) is finite & F' c= bool(the carrier of T)
    by A1,FINSET_1:24;
   hence F' is finite by FINSET_1:13;
