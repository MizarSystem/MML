reserve f for non empty FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
        i,j,k,k1,k2,n,i1,i2,j1,j2 for Nat,
        r,s,r1,r2 for Real,
        p,q,p1,q1 for Point of TOP-REAL 2,
        G for Go-board,
        x for set;

theorem Th1:
 abs(r1-r2) > s implies r1+s < r2 or r2+s < r1
proof assume
A1: abs(r1-r2) > s;
     now per cases;
   case r1 < r2;
     then r1 - r2 < 0 by REAL_2:105;
     then abs(r1-r2) = -(r1-r2) by ABSVALUE:def 1
       .= r2 - r1;
    hence r1+s < r2 by A1,REAL_1:86;
   end;
   case r2 <= r1;
     then r1 - r2 >= 0 by SQUARE_1:12;
     then abs(r1-r2) = r1 - r2 by ABSVALUE:def 1;
    hence r2+s < r1 by A1,REAL_1:86;
  end;
  end;
 hence r1+s < r2 or r2+s < r1;
end;

theorem Th2:
abs(r - s) = 0 iff r = s
proof
 hereby assume abs(r - s) = 0;
   then r - s = 0 by ABSVALUE:7;
   then r = s + 0;
  hence r = s;
 end;
 assume r = s;
 hence abs(r - s) = 0 by ABSVALUE:7;
end;

theorem Th3:
 for p,p1,q being Point of TOP-REAL n st p + p1 = q + p1
  holds p = q
 proof let p,p1,q be Point of TOP-REAL n such that
A1: p + p1 = q + p1;
  thus p = p + 0.REAL n by EUCLID:31
        .= p + (p1 - p1) by EUCLID:46
        .= p + p1 - p1 by EUCLID:49

        .= q + 0.REAL n by EUCLID:46
        .= q by EUCLID:31;
 end;

theorem
   for p,p1,q being Point of TOP-REAL n st p1 + p = p1 + q
  holds p = q by Th3;

theorem Th5:
 p1 in LSeg(p,q) & p`1 = q`1 implies p1`1 = q`1
proof assume p1 in LSeg(p,q);
 then consider r such that
       0<=r & r<=1 and
A1: p1 = (1-r)*p+r*q by SPPOL_1:21;
A2:  p1`1 = ((1-r)*p)`1+(r*q)`1 by A1,TOPREAL3:7
      .= ((1-r)*p)`1+r*q`1 by TOPREAL3:9
      .= (1-r)*p`1+r*q`1 by TOPREAL3:9;
 assume p`1 = q`1;
 hence p1`1 = q`1 by A2;
end;

theorem Th6:
 p1 in LSeg(p,q) & p`2 = q`2 implies p1`2 = q`2
proof assume p1 in LSeg(p,q);
 then consider r such that
       0<=r & r<=1 and
A1: p1 = (1-r)*p+r*q by SPPOL_1:21;
A2:  p1`2 = ((1-r)*p)`2+(r*q)`2 by A1,TOPREAL3:7
      .= ((1-r)*p)`2+r*q`2 by TOPREAL3:9
      .= (1-r)*p`2+r*q`2 by TOPREAL3:9;
 assume p`2 = q`2;
 hence p1`2 = q`2 by A2;
end;

theorem Th7:
 1/2*(p+q) in LSeg(p,q)
proof
     1/2*(p+q) = (1-1/2)*(p)+1/2*(q) by EUCLID:36;
 hence 1/2*(p+q) in LSeg(p,q) by SPPOL_1:22;
end;

theorem Th8:
 p`1 = q`1 & q`1 = p1`1 & p`2 <= q`2 & q`2 <= p1`2 implies q in LSeg(p,p1)
 proof assume that
A1: p`1 = q`1 and
A2: q`1 = p1`1 and
A3: p`2 <= q`2 and
A4: q`2 <= p1`2;
A5: p`2 <= p1`2 by A3,A4,AXIOMS:22;

     then p = |[p1`1,p1`2]| by A1,A2,EUCLID:57 .= p1 by EUCLID:57;
     then A7:   LSeg(p,p1) = {p} by TOPREAL1:7;
        p`2 = q`2 by A3,A4,A6,AXIOMS:21;
     then q = |[p`1,p`2]| by A1,EUCLID:57 .= p by EUCLID:57;
    hence thesis by A7,TARSKI:def 1;
   end;
   suppose
A8:  p`2 < p1`2;
   A9: q in {q1: q1`1 = q`1 & p`2 <= q1`2 & q1`2 <= p1`2} by A3,A4;
      p = |[q`1,p`2]| & p1 = |[q`1,p1`2]| by A1,A2,EUCLID:57;
  hence q in LSeg(p,p1) by A8,A9,TOPREAL3:15;
 end;
 end;

theorem Th9:
 p`1 <= q`1 & q`1 <= p1`1 & p`2 = q`2 & q`2 = p1`2 implies q in LSeg(p,p1)
 proof assume that
A1: p`1 <= q`1 and

proof let D be non empty set;
 let i,j; let M be Matrix of D;
A1: Indices M = [:dom M,Seg width M:] by MATRIX_1:def 5;
 assume 1 <= i & i <= len M & 1 <= j & j <= width M;
