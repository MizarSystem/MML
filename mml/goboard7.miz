reserve f for non empty FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2,
  i,j,k,k1,k2,n,i1,i2,j1,j2 for Element of NAT,
  r,s,r1,r2 for Real,
  p,q,p1,q1 for Point of TOP-REAL 2,
  G for Go-board;

theorem Th1:
  abs(r1-r2) > s implies r1+s < r2 or r2+s < r1
proof
  assume
A1: abs(r1-r2) > s;
  now
    per cases;
    case
      r1 < r2;
      then r1 - r2 < 0 by XREAL_1:51;
      then abs(r1-r2) = -(r1-r2) by ABSVALUE:def 1
        .= r2 - r1;
      hence r1+s < r2 by A1,XREAL_1:22;
    end;
    case
      r2 <= r1;
      then r1 - r2 >= 0 by XREAL_1:50;
      then abs(r1-r2) = r1 - r2 by ABSVALUE:def 1;
      hence r2+s < r1 by A1,XREAL_1:22;
    end;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th2:
  abs(r - s) = 0 iff r = s
proof
  hereby
    assume abs(r - s) = 0;
    then r - s = 0 by ABSVALUE:7;
    hence r = s;
  end;
  assume r = s;
  hence thesis by ABSVALUE:7;

proof
  let p,p1,q be Point of TOP-REAL n such that

theorem Th6:
  p1 in LSeg(p,q) & p`2 = q`2 implies p1`2 = q`2
proof
  assume p1 in LSeg(p,q);
  then consider r such that
