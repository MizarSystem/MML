theorem Th1:
 for X,A,B being set st A in Fin X & B c= A holds B in Fin X
proof let X,A,B be set such that
A1: A in Fin X and
A2: B c= A;
      A is finite & A c= X by A1,FINSUB_1:def 5;
  then B is finite & B c= X by A2,FINSET_1:13,XBOOLE_1:1;
 hence B in Fin X by FINSUB_1:def 5;
end;

theorem Th2:
 for X being set, F being Subset-Family of X st F c= Fin X
  holds meet F in Fin X
proof
 let X be set, F be Subset-Family of X such that
A1: F c= Fin X;
 per cases;
 suppose F = {};
 hence meet F in Fin X by FINSUB_1:18,SETFAM_1:2;
 end;
 suppose F <> {};
  then consider A being set such that
A2: A in F by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
      meet F c= A by A2,SETFAM_1:4;
 hence meet F in Fin X by A1,A2,Th1;

    let x,y be Element of X;
         x = w & y = w by A1,TARSKI:def 1;

    consider w being set such that
A3:   w in X by XBOOLE_0:def 1;
        for z being set holds z in X iff z = w by A2,A3;
    then X = {w} by TARSKI:def 1;

  consider f being Function such that
A1: dom f = F and
A2: for x being set st x in F holds f.x = F(x) from FUNCT_1:sch 3;

 thus dom f = F by A1;
 thus rng f c= COMPLEMENT F

 Y is countable
proof let X,Y be set such that

theorem

theorem Th15:
 for X being 1-sorted, F being Subset-Family of X
  holds Intersect COMPLEMENT F = (union F)`
proof let X be 1-sorted, F be Subset-Family of X;
 per cases;
 suppose
A1: F <> {};
  then COMPLEMENT F <> {} by SETFAM_1:46;
 hence Intersect COMPLEMENT F = meet COMPLEMENT F by SETFAM_1:def 10

proof let X be 1-sorted, F be Subset-Family of X;
 thus union COMPLEMENT F = (union COMPLEMENT F)``
