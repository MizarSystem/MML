theorem Th1: r<=0 implies abs(r)=-r
proof assume
A1:r<=0;
  per cases by A1;
  suppose r<0;
  hence abs(r)=-r by ABSVALUE:def 1;

 proof let n,m;assume A1: n<=m & m<=n+2;

 proof let n,m;assume A1:n<=m & m<=n+3;
   per cases;

    hence m=n or m=n+1 or m=n+2 or m=n+3 by A1,Th2;
   end;
   suppose m>n+2;
     then m=n+2 or m=n+2+1 by A1,NAT_1:27;
    hence thesis;

 end;

theorem Th4:for n,m st n<=m & m<=n+4 holds
m=n or m=n+1 or m=n+2 or m=n+3 or m=n+4
proof let n,m;assume A1:n<=m & m<=n+4;
   per cases;
   suppose m<=n+3;
    hence m=n or m=n+1 or m=n+2 or m=n+3 or m=n+4 by A1,Th3;
   end;
   suppose m>n+3;
     then m=n+3 or m=n+3+1 by A1,NAT_1:27;

end;
end;

theorem Th5: for a,b being real number st a>=0 & b>=0 holds a+b>=0
proof let a,b be real number;assume a>=0 & b>=0;
  then a+b>=0+0 by REAL_1:55;
 hence a+b>=0;
end;

theorem Th6: for a,b being real number st a>0 & b>=0 holds a+b>0
proof let a,b be real number;assume a>0 & b>=0;

end;

theorem Th7: for f being FinSequence st rng f={x,y} & len f=2
holds f.1=x & f.2=y or f.1=y & f.2=x
proof let f be FinSequence;assume A1:rng f={x,y} & len f=2;
  then 1 in Seg len f by FINSEQ_1:3;
  then 1 in dom f by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
then A2:f.1 in rng f by FUNCT_1:def 5;

  A4:now assume A5:f.1=x & f.2=x;
         y in rng f by A1,TARSKI:def 2;

    reconsider nz=z as Nat by A6;
A8: 1<=nz & nz<=len f by A7,FINSEQ_1:3;
    per cases by A1,A8,NAT_1:27;
    suppose nz=1; hence f.1=x & f.2=y by A5,A6;
    end;
    suppose nz=1+1; hence f.1=x & f.2=y by A5,A6;
  end;
  end;
       now assume A9:f.1=y & f.2=y;
         x in rng f by A1,TARSKI:def 2;

    suppose nz=1; hence f.1=x & f.2=y by A9,A10;
    end;
    suppose nz=1+1; hence f.1=x & f.2=y by A9,A10;
  end;

end;

theorem Th8: for f being increasing FinSequence of REAL

        now assume A2:f.1=s & f.2=r;
         1 in Seg len f by A1,FINSEQ_1:3;

         2 in Seg len f by A1,FINSEQ_1:3;
    then 2 in dom f by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
    hence f.1=r & f.2=s by A1,A2,A3,GOBOARD1:def 1;
   end;
 hence f.1=r & f.2=s by A1,Th7;
end;

reserve p,p1,p2,p3,q,q1,q2,q3,q4 for Point of TOP-REAL n;

theorem Th9: p1+p2-p3=p1-p3+p2
proof
 thus p1+p2-p3=p1+p2+-p3 by EUCLID:45
 .=p1+-p3+p2 by EUCLID:30 .=p1-p3+p2 by EUCLID:45;
end;

theorem    abs(|.q.|)=|.q.|
 proof
     |.q.|>=0 by TOPRNS_1:26;
  hence thesis by ABSVALUE:def 1;
 end;

theorem Th11: abs(|.q1.|- |.q2.|)<=|.q1-q2.|
 proof
   per cases;
   suppose |.q1.|>=|.q2.|;
     then |.q1.|- |.q2.|>=0 by SQUARE_1:12;
     then |.q1.|- |.q2.|=abs(|.q1.|- |.q2.|) by ABSVALUE:def 1;
    hence thesis by TOPRNS_1:33;
   end;
   suppose |.q1.|<|.q2.|;
     then A1: |.q2.|- |.q1.|>0 by SQUARE_1:11;
         |.q2.|- |.q1.|<= |.q2-q1.| by TOPRNS_1:33;
    then abs(|.q2.|- |.q1.|)<= |.q2-q1.| by A1,ABSVALUE:def 1;
    then abs(|.q2.|- |.q1.|)<= |.q1-q2.| by TOPRNS_1:28;
    hence thesis by UNIFORM1:13;
 end;
 end;

theorem Th12: |.|[r]|.|=abs(r)
proof
    set p=|[r]|;
    reconsider w=|[r]| as Element of REAL 1 by EUCLID:25;
    A1: |.p.|=|.w.| by JGRAPH_1:def 5;
    A2: |.w.| = sqrt Sum sqr w by EUCLID:def 5;
         0 <= Sum sqr w by RVSUM_1:116;
    then A3: (|.p.|)^2=Sum sqr w by A1,A2,SQUARE_1:def 4;
    A4: |.p.|>=0 by TOPRNS_1:26;
         w=<*r*> by JORDAN2B:def 2;
    then sqr w=<*r^2*> by RVSUM_1:81;
    then (|.p.|)^2 = r^2 by A3,RVSUM_1:103;
    then (|.p.|) =sqrt (r^2) by A4,SQUARE_1:89
           .=abs r by COMPLEX1:158;
 hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th13: q-0.REAL n=q & (0.REAL n)-q = -q
proof
   thus q-0.REAL n=q-(q-q) by EUCLID:46 .=q-q+q by EUCLID:51 .=q by EUCLID:52;
  thus (0.REAL n)-q =-q--q -q by EUCLID:46.= -q+--q-q by EUCLID:45
  .=-q+q-q by EUCLID:39
  .=-q by EUCLID:52;

   proof
    let w1,w2 be Point of TOP-REAL n;
    assume A2:w1 in P & w2 in P & w1<>w2;
    then A3: LSeg(w1,w2) c= P by A1;
         LSeg(w1,w2) is_an_arc_of w1,w2 by A2,TOPREAL1:15;
    then consider f being map of I[01], (TOP-REAL n)|LSeg(w1,w2) such that

    A5:f is continuous by A4,TOPS_2:def 5;
    A6: rng f = [#]((TOP-REAL n)|LSeg(w1,w2)) by A4,TOPS_2:def 5;
    then A7: rng f c= P by A3,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
    then [#]((TOP-REAL n)|LSeg(w1,w2)) c= [#]((TOP-REAL n)|P)
              by A6,PRE_TOPC:def 10;
    then [#]((TOP-REAL n)|LSeg(w1,w2))
          c=the carrier of ((TOP-REAL n)|P) by PRE_TOPC:12;
    then the carrier of ((TOP-REAL n)|LSeg(w1,w2))
       c= the carrier of ((TOP-REAL n)|P) by PRE_TOPC:12;
    then A8:(TOP-REAL n)|LSeg(w1,w2)
           is SubSpace of (TOP-REAL n)|P by TOPMETR:4;
         dom f=[.0 qua Real,1 qua Real.] by BORSUK_1:83,FUNCT_2:def 1;
    then reconsider g=f as Function of [.0 qua Real,1 qua Real.],P
                                  by A7,FUNCT_2:4;
          the carrier of (TOP-REAL n)|P = P by JORDAN1:1;
    then reconsider gt=g as map of I[01],(TOP-REAL n)|P
      by BORSUK_1:83;
         gt is continuous by A5,A8,TOPMETR:7;
    hence thesis by A4;
   end;
   hence thesis by JORDAN1:5;
end;

theorem Th15:for G being non empty TopSpace,
P being Subset of G,A being Subset of G,
Q being Subset of G|A st P=Q & P is connected

  Q be Subset of G|A;
 assume that
A1: P=Q and
A2: P is connected;
  A3:G|P is connected by A2,CONNSP_1:def 3;
       Q c= the carrier of G|A;
  then Q c= A by JORDAN1:1;
  then G|P=(G|A)|Q by A1,JORDAN6:47;
 hence Q is connected by A3,CONNSP_1:def 3;
