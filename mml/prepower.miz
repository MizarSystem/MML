  k>=n & r >= 1 implies r |^ k >= r |^ n
proof
  assume that
A1: k>=n and
A2: r >= 1;
  consider m be Nat such that
A3: k = n + m by A1,NAT_1:10;
A4: r |^ k = r |^ n * r |^ m by A3,NEWTON:13;
  r |^ n >= 1 by A2,Th19;
  hence thesis by A2,A4,Th19,XREAL_1:153;

theorem Th108:
  for n,m,l be Element of NAT st n divides m & n divides l holds
  n divides m-l
proof
  let n,m,l be Element of NAT;
  assume that
A1: n divides m and
A2: n divides l;
A3: -l =-n*(l div n) by A2,NAT_D:3
    .=n*(-(l div n));
  m = n * (m div n) by A1,NAT_D:3;
  then m - l =n * ((m div n) + -(l div n)) by A3;
  hence thesis by INT_1:def 9;
end;

theorem
  m divides n iff m divides (n qua Integer);

theorem Th110:
  m gcd n= m gcd abs(n-m)
proof
  set x=m gcd n, y=m gcd abs( n - m );
A1: x divides m by NAT_D:def 5;
A2: x divides n by NAT_D:def 5;
A3: y divides m by NAT_D:def 5;
  per cases;
  suppose
    n-m >= 0;
    then reconsider nm=n-m as Element of NAT by INT_1:16;
A4: abs( n - m )=nm by ABSVALUE:def 1;
    then y divides nm by NAT_D:def 5;
    then y divides nm+m by A3,NAT_D:8;
    then
A5: y divides x by A3,NAT_D:def 5;
    x divides n-m by A1,A2,Th108;
    then x divides y by A1,A4,NAT_D:def 5;
    hence thesis by A5,NAT_D:5;
  end;
  suppose
A6: n-m < 0;
    reconsider nn=n as Integer;
A7: abs( n - m )=-(n-m) by A6,ABSVALUE:def 1
      .=m-n;
    then reconsider mn=m-n as Element of NAT;
    y divides mn by A7,NAT_D:def 5;
    then y divides mn-m by A3,Th108;
    then y divides nn by INT_2:14;
    then
A8: y divides x by A3,NAT_D:def 5;
    x divides m-n by A1,A2,Th108;
    then x divides y by A1,A7,NAT_D:def 5;
    hence thesis by A8,NAT_D:5;
  end;

theorem
  for a,b be Integer st a>=0 & b>=0 holds a gcd b = a gcd (b-a)
proof
  let a,b be Integer;
  assume that
A1: a>=0 and
A2: b>=0;
  thus a gcd b=abs(a) gcd abs(b) by INT_2:51
    .=abs(a) gcd abs(abs(b)-abs(a)) by Th110
    .=abs(a) gcd abs(b-abs(a)) by A2,ABSVALUE:def 1
    .=abs(a) gcd abs(b-a) by A1,ABSVALUE:def 1
    .=a gcd (b-a) by INT_2:51;

theorem
  a>=0 implies a #Z l >= 0 by Lm5;

theorem
  a > 0 implies a #Q l = a #Z l
proof
  assume
  a > 0;
  then a #Z l > 0 by Th49;
  then
A1: a #Z l = 1-Root (a #Z l) |^ 1 by Def3;
  denominator l=1 by RAT_1:40;
  hence a #Q l = 1-Root (a #Z l) by RAT_1:40
    .= a #Z l by A1,NEWTON:10;
