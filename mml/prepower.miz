theorem Th2:

proof assume that A1: s1 is convergent and
                  A2: for n holds s1.n>=a;
 deffunc F(set) = a;
 consider s being Real_Sequence such that A3:
 for n holds s.n = F(n) from SEQ_1:sch 1;
 A4: s is constant by A3,SEQM_3:def 6;
 then A5: s is convergent by SEQ_4:39;
 A6: lim s = s.0 by A4,SEQ_4:41 .= a by A3;
   now let n; s1.n >= a by A2; hence s1.n >= s.n by A3; end;

theorem Th4:
 s1 = a GeoSeq iff s1.0 = 1 & for m holds s1.(m+1) = s1.m * a
proof
 hereby assume
A1: s1 = a GeoSeq;
  hence s1.0 = a|^0 by Def1 .= 1 by NEWTON:9;

               .= a|^m * a by NEWTON:11
               .= s1.m * a by A1,Def1;

A3: for m holds s1.(m+1) = s1.m * a;
defpred P[Nat] means s1.$1 = a GeoSeq.$1;
s1.0 = a|^0 by A2,NEWTON:9 .= a GeoSeq.0 by Def1;
then A4: P[0];
A5: for m st P[m] holds P[m+1]
   proof let m such that
A6:  s1.m = a GeoSeq.m;
    thus s1.(m+1) = s1.m * a by A3
             .= a|^m * a by A6,Def1
             .= a|^(m+1) by NEWTON:11
             .= a GeoSeq.(m+1) by Def1;
   end;
    for m holds P[m] from NAT_1:sch 1(A4,A5);
 hence s1 = a GeoSeq by FUNCT_2:113;
