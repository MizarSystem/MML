theorem Th2:
  for x1,y1,x2,y2 be Element of REAL holds
    [*x1,y1*] + [*x2,y2*] = [*x1 + x2,y1 + y2*]
     proof
      let x1,y1,x2,y2 be Element of REAL;
      thus [*x1,y1*] + [*x2,y2*] =

  theorem
       z <> the Zero of F_Complex implies |.z".| = |.z.|"
    proof
     reconsider z1=z as Element of COMPLEX by Def1;
     assume A1: z <> the Zero of F_Complex;
     z <> 0.F_Complex by A1,Def1,Th9;
     then z" = z1" by Th7;
     hence |.z".| = |.z1".|
                 .= |.z1.|" by COMPLEX1:152
                 .= |.z.|";
    end;

  theorem
       z2 <> the Zero of F_Complex implies |.z1.| / |.z2.| = |.z1 / z2.|
    proof
     reconsider z1'=z1,z2'=z2 as Element of COMPLEX by Def1;
     assume A1: z2 <> the Zero of F_Complex;
         z2 <> 0.F_Complex by A1,Def1,Th9;
     then A3: z1' / z2' = z1 / z2 by Th8;
     thus |.z1.| / |.z2.| = |.z1' / z2'.| by COMPLEX1:153
                          .= |.z1 / z2.| by A3;
