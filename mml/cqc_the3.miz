A15: for k being Element of NAT, P being (QC-pred_symbol of k), ll being
  QC-variable_list of k holds P[P!ll]
  proof
    let k be Element of NAT, P be (QC-pred_symbol of k), ll be
    QC-variable_list of k;
A16: still_not-bound_in ((P!ll).x) = still_not-bound_in (P!Subst(ll,a.0.-->
    x)) by CQC_LANG:30

    still_not-bound_in Subst(ll,a.0.-->x) c= still_not-bound_in ll \/ {x}
    by Th62;

  VERUM.x = VERUM by CQC_LANG:28;
  then

theorem Th65:
  p = h.x & x <> y & not y in still_not-bound_in h implies not y
  in still_not-bound_in p
proof
  assume that
A1: p = h.x and
A2: x <> y and
A3: not y in still_not-bound_in h and
A4: y in still_not-bound_in p;
A5: still_not-bound_in p c= still_not-bound_in h \/ {x} by A1,Th64;
  per cases by A4,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
  suppose
    y in still_not-bound_in h;
    hence contradiction by A3;
  end;
  suppose
    y in {x};
    hence contradiction by A2,TARSKI:def 1;
  end;
end;

theorem
  p = h.x & q = h.y & not x in still_not-bound_in h & not y in
  still_not-bound_in h implies All(x,p) <==> All(y,q)
proof
  assume that
A1: p = h.x and
A2: q = h.y and
A3: not x in still_not-bound_in h and
A4: not y in still_not-bound_in h;
  per cases;
  suppose
    x = y;
    hence thesis by A1,A2;
  end;
  suppose
A5: x <> y;
    then not x in still_not-bound_in q by A2,A3,Th65;
    then
A6: All(y,q) => All(x,p) is valid by A1,A2,A4,CQC_THE2:30;
    not y in still_not-bound_in p by A1,A4,A5,Th65;
    then All(x,p) => All(y,q) is valid by A1,A2,A3,CQC_THE2:30;
    hence thesis by A6,Th50;
