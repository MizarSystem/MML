begin :: Preliminaries

reserve x,y for set,
  N for Element of NAT,
  c,i,j,k,l,m,n for Nat,
  D for non
  empty set,
  s for Element of 2Set Seg (n+2),
  p, q for Element of Permutations(n)
  ,
  p1, q1 for Element of Permutations(n+1),
  p2, q2 for Element of Permutations(n
  +2),
  K for Field,
  a, b for Element of K,
  f for FinSequence of K,
  A for (Matrix
  of K),
  AD for Matrix of n,m,D,
  pD for FinSequence of D,
  M for Matrix of n,K;

theorem Th1:
  for f be FinSequence, i be Nat st i in dom f holds len Del(f,i) =
  len f -' 1
proof
  let f be FinSequence, i be Nat;
  assume
  i in dom f;
  then ex m be Nat st len f = m + 1 & len Del(f,i) = m by FINSEQ_3:113;
  hence thesis by NAT_D:34;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for i,j,n being Nat, M being Matrix of n,K st i in dom M holds
  len Deleting(M,i,j) = n-'1
proof
  let i,j,n be Nat, M be Matrix of n,K;
  assume
A1: i in dom M;
A2: len M = n by MATRIX_1:def 3;
  thus len Deleting(M,i,j)= len DelLine(M,i) by MATRIX_2:def 6
    .= n-'1 by A1,A2,Th1;
end;

theorem Th3:
  j in Seg width A implies width DelCol(A,j) = width A-'1
proof
  set DC=DelCol(A,j);
A1: len DC = len A by MATRIX_2:def 6;
  assume
A2: j in Seg width A;
  then Seg width A <> {};
  then width A <>0;
  then len A > 0 by MATRIX_1:def 4;
  then consider t being FinSequence such that
A3: t in rng DC and
A4: len t = width DC by A1,MATRIX_1:def 4;
  consider k9 be set such that
A5: k9 in dom DelCol(A,j) and
A6: DC.k9 = t by A3,FUNCT_1:def 5;
  k9 in Seg len DC by A5,FINSEQ_1:def 3;

A7: k9=k and
  1<=k and
  k<=len DC;
  k in dom A by A1,A5,A7,FINSEQ_3:31;
  then
A8: t=Del(Line(A,k),j) by A6,A7,MATRIX_2:def 6;
A9: len Line(A,k)=width A by MATRIX_1:def 8;
  then dom Line(A,k)=Seg (width A) by FINSEQ_1:def 3;
  hence thesis by A2,A4,A9,A8,Th1;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for i be Nat st len A > 1 holds width A = width DelLine(A,i)
proof
  let i be Nat;
  assume
A1: len A>1;
  per cases;
  suppose
    i in dom A;
    then consider m be Nat such that
A2: len A = m + 1 and
A3: len Del(A,i) = m by FINSEQ_3:113;
A4: m>=1 by A1,A2,NAT_1:13;
    then

A7: rng Del(A,i) c= rng A by FINSEQ_3:115;
A8: DelLine(A,i).m=Line(DelLine(A,i),m) by A5,MATRIX_2:18;
    A is Matrix of len A,width A,K by A1,MATRIX_1:20;
    then len Line(DelLine(A,i),m)=width A by A6,A8,A7,MATRIX_1:def 3;
    hence thesis by A3,A4,A6,A8,MATRIX_1:def 4;
  end;
  suppose
    not i in dom A;
    hence thesis by FINSEQ_3:113;
  end;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for i being Nat st j in Seg width M holds width Deleting(M,i,j) =
  n-' 1
proof
  let i be Nat;
  assume
A1: j in Seg width M;
  per cases;
  suppose
A2: len M<=1 & i in dom M;
X:  Seg width M <> {} by A1;
    then width M <> {};
    then len M > 0 by MATRIX_1:def 4,X;
    then
A3: len M=1 by A2,NAT_1:26;
A4: len Deleting(M,i,j)=n-'1 by A2,Th2;
    len M=n by MATRIX_1:25;
    then len Deleting(M,i,j)=0 by A3,A4,XREAL_1:234;
    hence thesis by A4,MATRIX_1:def 4;
  end;
  suppose
A5: len M>1;
A6: width M=n by MATRIX_1:25;
    width M=width DelLine(M,i) by A5,Th4;
    hence thesis by A1,A6,Th3;
  end;
  suppose
A7: not i in dom M;
A8: width M=n by MATRIX_1:25;
    DelLine(M,i)=M by A7,FINSEQ_3:113;
    hence thesis by A1,A8,Th3;
  end;
end;

definition
  let G be non empty multMagma;
  let B be Function of [:the carrier of G,NAT:], the carrier of G;
  let g be Element of G, i be Nat;

  proof
    let x;
    assume
    x in P;
    then x is Permutation of X by MATRIX_2:def 11;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  PER c= P
  proof
    let x;
    assume
    x in PER;
    then ex F be Function of X,X st x=F & F is Permutation of X;
    hence thesis by MATRIX_2:def 11;
  end;
  then P=PER by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
  hence card P = card X! by CARD_FIN:8
    .= n! by FINSEQ_1:78;
end;

theorem Th7:
  for i,j st i in Seg (n+1) & j in Seg (n+1) holds card {p1: p1.i =

A4: X9\/{i}=X by A1,ZFMISC_1:140;
A5: F9 c= F
  proof
    let x;
    assume
    x in F9;

A6: f=x and
A7: f is one-to-one and
A8: f.i=j by A4,A3;

    then f is onto by A7,STIRL2_1:70;

A15: not i in X9 by ZFMISC_1:64;
  then
A16: card X=card X9+1 by A4,CARD_2:54;
  then Y is empty implies X9 is empty by A14;
