theorem Th27:
  for f being (Morphism of RingCat(UN)), f9 being Element of
  Morphs(RingObjects(UN)), b being Object of RingCat(UN), b9 being Element of
  RingObjects(UN) holds f is strict Element of Morphs(RingObjects(UN)) & f9 is
Morphism of RingCat(UN) & b is strict Element of RingObjects(UN) & b9 is Object
  of RingCat(UN)
proof
  set C = RingCat(UN), V = RingObjects(UN);
  set X = Morphs(V);
  let f be (Morphism of C), f9 be Element of X, b be Object of C, b9 be
  Element of V;
  consider x such that
  x in UN and
A1: GO x,b by Def17;
  ex G,H being Element of V st G <= H & f is Morphism of G,H by Def18;
  hence f is strict Element of X;
  thus f9 is Morphism of C;
  ex x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6 being set st x = [[x1,x2,x3,x4],x5,x6] & ex G being
strict Ring st b = G & x1 = the carrier of G & x2 = the addF of G & x3 = comp G
  & x4 = 0.G & x5 = the multF of G & x6 = 1.G by A1,Def16;
  hence b is strict Element of V;
  thus thesis;

theorem Th28:
  for b being Object of RingCat(UN), b9 being Element of
  RingObjects(UN) st b = b9 holds id b = ID(b9)
proof
  set C = RingCat(UN), V = RingObjects(UN);
  let b be Object of C, b9 be Element of V;
  assume b = b9;
  hence id b = (ID(V)).b9 by CAT_1:def 2
    .= ID(b9) by Def22;
end;

theorem Th30:
  for f,g being (Morphism of RingCat(UN)), f9,g9 being Element of
  Morphs(RingObjects(UN)) st f = f9 & g = g9 holds (dom g = cod f iff dom g9 =
  cod f9) & (dom g = cod f iff [g9,f9] in dom comp(RingObjects(UN))) & (dom g =
cod f implies g*f = g9*f9) & (dom f = dom g iff dom f9 = dom g9) & (cod f = cod
  g iff cod f9 = cod g9)
proof
  set C = RingCat(UN), V = RingObjects(UN);
  set X = Morphs(V);
  let f,g be Morphism of C;
  let f9,g9 be Element of X;
  assume that
A1: f = f9 and
A2: g = g9;
A3: cod f = cod f9 by A1,Def21;
  hence dom g = cod f iff dom g9 = cod f9 by A2,Def20;
  dom g = dom g9 by A2,Def20;
  hence
A4: dom g = cod f iff [g9,f9] in dom comp(V) by A3,Def23;
  thus dom g = cod f implies g*f = g9*f9
  proof
    assume
A5: dom g = cod f;
    then [g,f] in dom (the Comp of C) by Th26;
    hence g*f = (comp(V)).(g9,f9) by A1,A2,CAT_1:def 1
      .= g9*f9 by A4,A5,Def23;
  end;
  dom f = dom f9 by A1,Def20;
  hence dom f = dom g iff dom f9 = dom g9 by A2,Def20;
  cod g = cod g9 by A2,Def21;
  hence thesis by A1,Def21;

  reconsider g9 = g as strict Element of X by Th27;
  reconsider f9 = f as strict Element of X by Th27;

  let b be Object of C;

  hence

  thus
A3: cod id b = cod ID(b99) by A1,Def21
    .= b;
  thus for f being Morphism of C st cod f = b holds (id b)*f = f
  proof
    let f be Morphism of C such that

    reconsider f1 = f as strict Element of X by Th27;
    reconsider f9 = f1 as strict RingMorphism;
A5: cod f9 = b99 by A4,Def21;
    thus (id b)*f = ID(b99)*f9 by A1,A2,A4,Th30

  end;
  thus for g being Morphism of C st dom g = b holds g*(id b) = g
  proof

    reconsider f1 = f as strict Element of X by Th27;
    reconsider f9 = f1 as strict RingMorphism;
A7: dom f9 = b99 by A6,Def20;
