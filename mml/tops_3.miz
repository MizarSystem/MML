reserve X for TopStruct, A for Subset of X;

theorem Th1:
 (A = {}X iff  A` = [#]X) &
   (A = {} iff  A` = the carrier of X)
 proof
  thus A = {}X iff  A` = [#]X
   proof thus A = {}X implies  A` = [#]X by PRE_TOPC:27;
    assume A` = [#]X;
     then A`` = {}X by TOPS_1:8;
    hence thesis;
   end;
  hence A = {} iff  A` = the carrier of X by PRE_TOPC:12;
 end;

theorem Th2:
 (A = [#]X iff  A` = {}X) &
   (A = the carrier of X iff  A` = {})
 proof
  thus A = [#]X iff  A` = {}X
   proof thus A = [#]X implies  A` = {}X by TOPS_1:8;
    assume A` = {}X;
     then A`` = [#]X by PRE_TOPC:27;
    hence thesis;
   end;
  hence A = the carrier of X iff  A` = {} by PRE_TOPC:12;
 end;

theorem Th3:
 for X being TopSpace, A,B being Subset of X holds
  Int A /\ Cl B c= Cl(A /\ B)
 proof
   let X be TopSpace, A,B be Subset of X;
         Int A c= A by TOPS_1:44;
   then (Int A) /\ B c= A /\ B by XBOOLE_1:26;
  then A1: Cl((Int A) /\ B) c= Cl(A /\ B) by PRE_TOPC:49;
     Int A /\ Cl B c= Cl((Int A) /\ B) by TOPS_1:40;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
 end;

reserve X for TopSpace, A,B for Subset of X;

theorem Th4:
 Int(A \/ B) c= (Cl A) \/ Int B
 proof
         (Int  A`) /\ Cl  B` c= Cl(( A`) /\  B`) by Th3;
   then (Cl(( A`) /\  B`))` c= ((Int  A`) /\ Cl  B`)` by PRE_TOPC:19;
   then Int((( A`) /\  B`)`) c= (((Int  A`) /\ Cl  B`))` by TDLAT_3:4;
    then Int(( A``) \/ ( B``)) c= (((Int  A`) /\ Cl  B`))` & ( A``) = A
         by SUBSET_1:30;
     then Int(A \/ B) c= (Int  A`)` \/ (Cl  B`)` by SUBSET_1:30;
   then Int(A \/ B) c= Cl A \/ (Cl  B`)` by TDLAT_3:2;
  hence thesis by TOPS_1:def 1;
 end;

theorem Th5:
 for A being Subset of X st A is closed holds Int(A \/ B) c= A \/ Int B
 proof
  let A be Subset of X;
  assume A is closed;
   then Cl A = A & Int(A \/ B) c= (Cl A) \/ Int B by Th4,PRE_TOPC:52;
  hence thesis;
 end;

theorem Th6:
 for A being Subset of X st A is closed holds Int(A \/ B) = Int(A \/ Int B)
 proof
  let A be Subset of X;
  assume A is closed;
   then Int(A \/ B) c= A \/ Int B by Th5;
   then Int Int(A \/ B) c= Int(A \/ Int B) by TOPS_1:48;
  then A1: Int(A \/ B) c= Int(A \/ Int B) by TOPS_1:45;
         Int B c= B by TOPS_1:44;
   then A \/ Int B c= A \/ B by XBOOLE_1:9;
   then Int(A \/ Int B) c= Int(A \/ B) by TOPS_1:48;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
 end;

theorem Th7:
 A misses Int Cl A implies Int Cl A = {}
 proof
  reconsider A' = A as Subset of X;
  assume A /\ Int Cl A = {};
   then A' misses Int Cl A' by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
   then (Cl A) misses (Int Cl A) by TSEP_1:40;
   then (Cl A) /\ (Int Cl A) = {} & Int Cl A c= Cl A
     by TOPS_1:44,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:28;
 end;

theorem
      A \/ Cl Int A = the carrier of X implies Cl Int A = the carrier of X
 proof
  reconsider A' = A as Subset of X;
  assume A \/ Cl Int A = the carrier of X;
    then (Int A) \/ (Cl Int A) = the carrier of X &
              Int A c= Cl Int A by PRE_TOPC:48,TDLAT_3:6;
  hence thesis by XBOOLE_1:12;
