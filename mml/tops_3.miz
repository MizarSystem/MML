reserve X for TopStruct,
  A for Subset of X;

theorem Th1:
  (A = {}X iff A` = [#]X) & (A = {} iff A` = the carrier of X)
proof
  thus A = {}X iff A` = [#]X
  proof
    thus A = {}X implies A` = [#]X;
    assume A` = [#]X;
    then A`` = {}X by XBOOLE_1:37;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th2:
  (A = [#]X iff A` = {}X) & (A = the carrier of X iff A` = {})
proof
  thus A = [#]X iff A` = {}X
  proof
    thus A = [#]X implies A` = {}X by XBOOLE_1:37;
    assume A` = {}X;
    then A`` = [#]X;
    hence thesis;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for X being TopSpace, A,B being Subset of X holds Int A /\ Cl B c= Cl(A /\ B)
proof
  let X be TopSpace, A,B be Subset of X;
  (Int A) /\ B c= A /\ B by TOPS_1:16,XBOOLE_1:26;
  then
A1: Cl((Int A) /\ B) c= Cl(A /\ B) by PRE_TOPC:19;
  Int A /\ Cl B c= Cl((Int A) /\ B) by TOPS_1:13;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_1:1;
end;

reserve X for TopSpace,
  A,B for Subset of X;

theorem Th4:
  Int(A \/ B) c= (Cl A) \/ Int B
proof
  (Int A`) /\ Cl B` c= Cl(( A`) /\ B`) by Th3;
  then (Cl(( A`) /\ B`))` c= ((Int A`) /\ Cl B`)` by SUBSET_1:12;
  then Int((( A`) /\ B`)`) c= (((Int A`) /\ Cl B`))` by TDLAT_3:3;
  then Int(( A``) \/ ( B``)) c= (((Int A`) /\ Cl B`))` by XBOOLE_1:54;
  then Int(A \/ B) c= (Int A`)` \/ (Cl B`)` by XBOOLE_1:54;
  then Int(A \/ B) c= Cl A \/ (Cl B`)` by TDLAT_3:1;
  hence thesis by TOPS_1:def 1;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for A being Subset of X st A is closed holds Int(A \/ B) c= A \/ Int B
proof
  let A be Subset of X;
  assume A is closed;
  then Cl A = A by PRE_TOPC:22;
  hence thesis by Th4;
end;

theorem Th6:
  for A being Subset of X st A is closed holds Int(A \/ B) = Int(A \/ Int B)
proof
  let A be Subset of X;
  A \/ Int B c= A \/ B by TOPS_1:16,XBOOLE_1:9;
  then
A1: Int(A \/ Int B) c= Int(A \/ B) by TOPS_1:19;
  assume A is closed;
  then Int Int(A \/ B) c= Int(A \/ Int B) by Th5,TOPS_1:19;
  hence thesis by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 10;
end;

theorem Th7:
  A misses Int Cl A implies Int Cl A = {}
proof
  reconsider A9 = A as Subset of X;
  assume A /\ Int Cl A = {};
  then A9 misses Int Cl A9 by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  then (Cl A) misses (Int Cl A) by TSEP_1:36;
  then (Cl A) /\ (Int Cl A) = {} by XBOOLE_0:def 7;
  hence thesis by TOPS_1:16,XBOOLE_1:28;
end;

theorem
  A \/ Cl Int A = the carrier of X implies Cl Int A = the carrier of X
proof
  assume A \/ Cl Int A = the carrier of X;
  then (Int A) \/ (Cl Int A) = the carrier of X by TDLAT_3:4;
  hence thesis by PRE_TOPC:18,XBOOLE_1:12;
