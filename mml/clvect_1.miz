theorem Th2:
  z = 0 or v = 0.V implies z * v = 0.V
proof
  assume
A1: z = 0 or v = 0.V;
  now
    per cases by A1;
    suppose
A2:   z = 0c;
      v + 0c * v = 1r * v + 0c * v by Def5
        .= (1r + 0c) * v by Def3
        .= v by Def5
        .= v + 0.V by RLVECT_1:10;
      hence thesis by A2,RLVECT_1:21;
    end;
    suppose
A3:   v = 0.V;
      z * 0.V + z * 0.V = z * (0.V + 0.V) by Def2
        .= z * 0.V by RLVECT_1:10
        .= z * 0.V + 0.V by RLVECT_1:10;
      hence thesis by A3,RLVECT_1:21;
    end;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th3:
  z * v = 0.V implies z = 0 or v = 0.V
proof
  assume that
A1: z * v = 0.V and
A2: z <> 0;
  thus v = 1r * v by Def5
    .= (z" * z) * v by A2,XCMPLX_0:def 7
    .= z" * 0.V by A1,Def4
    .= 0.V by Th2;
end;

theorem Th4:
  - v = (- 1r) * v
proof
  v + (- 1r) * v = 1r * v + (- 1r) * v by Def5
    .= (1r + (- 1r)) * v by Def3
    .= 0.V by Th2;
  hence (- v) = (- v) + (v + (- 1r) * v) by RLVECT_1:10

    .= 0.V + (- 1r) * v by RLVECT_1:16
    .= (- 1r) * v by RLVECT_1:10;
end;

theorem Th5:
  v = - v implies v = 0.V
proof
  assume v = - v;
  then 0.V = v - (- v) by RLVECT_1:28
    .= v + v by RLVECT_1:30
    .= 1r * v + v by Def5
    .= 1r * v + 1r * v by Def5
    .= (1r + 1r) * v by Def3;
  hence thesis by Th3;
end;

theorem
  v + v = 0.V implies v = 0.V
proof

  then v = - v by RLVECT_1:def 13;
  hence thesis by Th5;
end;

theorem Th7:
  z * (- v) = (- z) * v
proof
  thus z * (- v) = z * ((- 1r) * v) by Th4
    .= (z *(- 1r)) * v by Def4
    .= (- z) * v;
end;

theorem Th8:
  z * (- v) = - (z * v)

    .= z * v;
end;

theorem Th10:
  z * (v - u) = z * v - z * u
proof
  thus z * (v - u) = z * v + z * (- u) by Def2
    .= z * v - z * u by Th8;
end;

theorem Th11:
  (z1 - z2) * v = z1 * v - z2 * v
proof
  thus (z1 - z2) * v = (z1 + (- z2)) * v .= z1 * v + (- z2) * v by Def3
    .= z1 * v + z2 * (- v) by Th7
    .= z1 * v - z2 * v by Th8;
end;

theorem
  z <> 0 & z * v = z * u implies v = u
proof
  assume that
A1: z <> 0 and
A2: z * v = z * u;
  0.V = z * v - z * u by A2,RLVECT_1:28
    .= z * (v - u) by Th10;
  then v - u = 0.V by A1,Th3;
  hence thesis by RLVECT_1:35;
end;

theorem
  v <> 0.V & z1 * v = z2 * v implies z1 = z2
proof
  assume that
A1: v <> 0.V and
A2: z1 * v = z2 * v;
  0.V = z1 * v - z2 * v by A2,RLVECT_1:28
    .= (z1 - z2) * v by Th11;
  then (- z2) + z1 = 0 by A1,Th3;
  hence thesis;

    proof
      let x,y be VECTOR of W;
      reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y as VECTOR of V by A1,TARSKI:def 3;
