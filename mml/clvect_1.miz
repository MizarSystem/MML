theorem Th2:
  z = 0 or v = 0.V implies z * v = 0.V
proof
  assume
A1: z = 0 or v = 0.V;
  now per cases by A1;
    suppose
A2:   z = 0c;
      v + 0c * v = 1r * v + 0c * v by Def2
        .= (1r + 0c) * v by Def2
        .= v by Def2
        .= v + 0.V by RLVECT_1:10;
      hence z * v = 0.V by A2,RLVECT_1:21;
    end;
    suppose
A3:   v = 0.V;
      z * 0.V + z * 0.V = z * (0.V + 0.V) by Def2
        .= z * 0.V by RLVECT_1:10
        .= z * 0.V + 0.V by RLVECT_1:10;
      hence z * v = 0.V by A3,RLVECT_1:21;
    end;
  end;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th3:
  z * v = 0.V implies z = 0 or v = 0.V
proof
  assume that
A1: z * v = 0.V and
A2: z <> 0;
  thus v = 1r * v by Def2
    .= (z" * z) * v by A2,COMPLEX1:def 7,XCMPLX_0:def 7
    .= z" * 0.V by A1,Def2
    .= 0.V by Th2;
end;

theorem Th4:
  - v = (- 1r) * v
proof
  v + (- 1r) * v = 1r * v + (- 1r) * v by Def2
    .= (1r + (- 1r)) * v by Def2
    .= 0.V by Th2;
  hence (- v) = (- v) + (v + (- 1r) * v) by RLVECT_1:10
    .= ((- v) + v) + (- 1r) * v by RLVECT_1:def 6
    .= 0.V + (- 1r) * v by RLVECT_1:16
    .= (- 1r) * v by RLVECT_1:10;
end;

theorem Th5:
  v = - v implies v = 0.V
proof
  assume v = - v;
  then
A1: 0.V = v - (- v) by RLVECT_1:28
    .= v + v by RLVECT_1:30
    .= 1r * v + v by Def2
    .= 1r * v + 1r * v by Def2

A2: Re(1r + 1r) = 1 + Re(1r) by COMPLEX1:15,19
    .= 2 by COMPLEX1:15;
  Im(1r + 1r) = 0 + Im(1r) by COMPLEX1:15,19
    .= 0 by COMPLEX1:15;
  then (Re(1r + 1r))^2 + (Im(1r + 1r))^2 > 0 by A2,SQUARE_1:60,74;
  then 1r + 1r <> 0c by COMPLEX1:13;
  hence thesis by A1,Th3;
end;

theorem
  v + v = 0.V implies v = 0.V
proof
  assume v + v = 0.V;
  then v = - v by RLVECT_1:def 11;
  hence thesis by Th5;
end;

theorem Th7:
  z * (- v) = (- z) * v
proof
  thus z * (- v) = z * ((- 1r) * v) by Th4
    .= (z *(- 1r)) * v by Def2
    .= (- z) * v by COMPLEX1:def 7;
end;

theorem Th8:
  z * (- v) = - (z * v)
proof
  thus z * (- v) = (- (1r * z)) * v by Th7,COMPLEX1:def 7
    .= ((- 1r) * z) * v
    .= (- 1r) * (z * v) by Def2
    .= - (z * v) by Th4;
end;

theorem
  (- z) * (- v) = z * v
proof
  thus (- z) * (- v) = (- (- z)) * v by Th7
    .= z * v;
end;

theorem Th10:
  z * (v - u) = z * v - z * u
proof
  thus z * (v - u) = z * v + z * (- u) by Def2
    .= z * v - z * u by Th8;
end;

theorem Th11:
  (z1 - z2) * v = z1 * v - z2 * v
proof
  thus (z1 - z2) * v = (z1 + (- z2)) * v
    .= z1 * v + (- z2) * v by Def2
    .= z1 * v + z2 * (- v) by Th7
    .= z1 * v - z2 * v by Th8;
end;

theorem
  z <> 0 & z * v = z * u implies v = u
proof
  assume that
A1: z <> 0 and
A2: z * v = z * u;
  0.V = z * v - z * u by A2,RLVECT_1:28
    .= z * (v - u) by Th10;
  then v - u = 0.V by A1,Th3;
  hence thesis by RLVECT_1:35;
end;

theorem
  v <> 0.V & z1 * v = z2 * v implies z1 = z2
proof
  assume that
A1: v <> 0.V and
A2: z1 * v = z2 * v;
  0.V = z1 * v - z2 * v by A2,RLVECT_1:28
    .= (z1 - z2) * v by Th11;
  then (- z2) + z1 = 0 by A1,Th3;
  hence thesis;

len F = 0 implies Sum(F) = 0.V
proof
  let V be non empty addLoopStr;

  proof
    set AV = the addF of V;

    proof
      let x,y be VECTOR of W;

      let x,y,z be VECTOR of W;

    proof
      let x be VECTOR of W;

      let z;
      let x,y be VECTOR of W;
      reconsider x1 = x, y1 = y as VECTOR of V by A1,TARSKI:def 3;

      let z1,z2;
      let x be VECTOR of W;

    proof
A1:   for z for v,w be VECTOR of W, v',w' be VECTOR of V st v=v' & w=w'
      holds v+w = v'+w' & z*v = z*v';
      thus for v,w being VECTOR of W holds v + w = w + v
      proof
        let v,w be VECTOR of W;
        reconsider v'=v,w'=w as VECTOR of V;
        thus v + w = w' + v' by A1
          .= w + v;
      end;
      thus for u,v,w being VECTOR of W holds (u + v) + w = u + (v + w)
      proof
        let u,v,w be VECTOR of W;
        reconsider u'=u,v'=v,w'=w as VECTOR of V;

      proof
        let v be VECTOR of W;

        thus v + 0.W = v' + 0.V

        reconsider w=w' as VECTOR of W;
        take w;
        thus v + w = 0.W by A2;
      end;
      thus for z for v,w being VECTOR of W holds z * (v + w) = z * v + z * w
      proof
        let z;
        let v,w be VECTOR of W;
        reconsider v'=v,w'=w as VECTOR of V;

      end;
      thus for z1,z2 for v being VECTOR of W holds (z1+z2) * v = z1* v + z2* v
      proof
        let z1,z2;
        let v be VECTOR of W;
        reconsider v'=v as VECTOR of V;

          .= z1 * v' + z2 * v' by Def2
          .= z1 * v + z2 * v;
      end;
      thus for z1,z2 for v being VECTOR of W holds (z1 * z2) * v = z1 * (z2 *

      proof
        let z1,z2;
        let v be VECTOR of W;
        reconsider v'=v as VECTOR of V;
        thus (z1 * z2) * v = (z1 * z2) * v'

          .= z1 * (z2 * v);
      end;

      proof
        let v be VECTOR of W;

        thus 1r * v = 1r * v'

      end;
    end;
    then reconsider W as ComplexLinearSpace;
    W is Subspace of V
