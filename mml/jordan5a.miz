:: Preliminaries

theorem Th1:
 for n being Nat,
     p, q being Point of TOP-REAL n,
     P being Subset of TOP-REAL n st
  P is_an_arc_of p, q holds P is compact
proof
 let n be Nat;
 let p, q be Point of TOP-REAL n;
 let P be Subset of TOP-REAL n;
 assume P is_an_arc_of p, q;
 then consider f be map of I[01], (TOP-REAL n)|P such that
A1:   f is_homeomorphism & f.0 = p & f.1 = q by TOPREAL1:def 2;
 per cases;
 suppose P <> {};
 then reconsider P' = P as non empty Subset of TOP-REAL n;
   f is continuous & rng f = [#] ((TOP-REAL n)|P') by A1,TOPS_2:def 5;
 then (TOP-REAL n)|P' is compact by COMPTS_1:23;
 hence thesis by COMPTS_1:12;
 end;
 suppose P = {}TOP-REAL n;
 hence thesis by COMPTS_1:9;
end;
end;

Lm1:
for n being Nat holds
the carrier of Euclid n = REAL n & the carrier of TOP-REAL n = REAL n
 proof
  let n be Nat;
    Euclid n = MetrStruct(#REAL n, Pitag_dist n#) &
   TOP-REAL n = TopSpaceMetr Euclid n by EUCLID:def 7,def 8;
  hence thesis by TOPMETR:16;
end;

theorem Th2:
 for r being real number holds
  0 <= r & r <= 1 iff r in the carrier of I[01]
proof
 let r be real number;
A1: r is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
A2: [.0,1.] = { r1 where r1 is Real : 0 <= r1 & r1 <= 1 } by RCOMP_1:def 1;
 hence 0 <= r & r <= 1 implies r in the carrier of I[01] by A1,BORSUK_1:83;
 assume r in the carrier of I[01];
 then consider r2 being Real such that A3: r2 = r & 0 <= r2 & r2 <= 1
    by A2,BORSUK_1:83;
 thus thesis by A3;
end;

theorem Th3:
 for n being Nat,
     p1, p2 being Point of TOP-REAL n,
     r1, r2 being real number st
   (1-r1)*p1+r1*p2 = (1-r2)*p1+r2*p2 holds
   r1 = r2 or p1 = p2
proof
 let n be Nat, p1, p2 be Point of TOP-REAL n, r1, r2 be real number;
 assume A1: (1-r1)*p1+r1*p2 = (1-r2)*p1+r2*p2;

   .= r2*p1+(-r1*p1+r1*p2) by EUCLID:30
   .= r2*p1+(-r2*p1+r2*p2) by A2,GOBOARD7:4
   .= r2*p1+-r2*p1+r2*p2 by EUCLID:30
   .= 0.REAL n + r2*p2 by EUCLID:40
   .= r2*p2 by EUCLID:31;
    (r2-r1)*p1 = (r2-r1)*p1 + 0.REAL n by EUCLID:31
     .= (r2-r1)*p1+(r1*p2 - r1*p2) by EUCLID:46
     .= r2*p2 - r1*p2 by A3,EUCLID:49
     .= (r2-r1)*p2 by EUCLID:54;
 then r2-r1=0 or p1 = p2 by EUCLID:38;
 hence thesis by XCMPLX_1:15;
