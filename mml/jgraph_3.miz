theorem Th33:
  for Kb,Cb being Subset of TOP-REAL 2 st Kb={q: -1=q`1 & -1<=q`2
& q`2<=1 or q`1=1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1 or -1=q`2 & -1<=q`1 & q`1<=1 or 1=q`2 & -1
  <=q`1 & q`1<=1}& Cb={p2 where p2 is Point of TOP-REAL 2: |.p2.|=1} holds
  Sq_Circ.:Kb=Cb
proof
  let Kb,Cb be Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
  assume
A1: Kb={q: -1=q`1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1 or q`1=1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1 or -1=q
`2 & -1<=q`1 & q`1<=1 or 1=q`2 & -1<=q`1 & q`1<=1}& Cb={p2 where p2 is Point of
  TOP-REAL 2: |.p2.|=1};
  thus Sq_Circ.:Kb c= Cb
  proof
    let y be set;
    assume y in Sq_Circ.:Kb;
    then consider x being set such that
    x in dom Sq_Circ and
A2: x in Kb and
