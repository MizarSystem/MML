begin ::Preliminaries

reserve x,y,z,u,a for real number;

Lm1: x^2+1 > 0
proof
    x^2 >= 0 by SQUARE_1:72;
  then x^2+1 >= 0+1 by REAL_1:55;
  hence thesis by AXIOMS:22;
end;

Lm2:TOP-REAL 2=TopSpaceMetr(Euclid 2) by EUCLID:def 8;
Lm3:dom proj1=the carrier of TOP-REAL 2 &
   dom proj2=the carrier of TOP-REAL 2 by FUNCT_2:def 1;

theorem Th1: x^2=y^2 implies x=y or x=-y
 proof assume x^2=y^2; then x^2-y^2=0 by XCMPLX_1:14;
   then (x-y)*(x+y)=0 by SQUARE_1:67;
   then x-y=0 or x+y=0 by XCMPLX_1:6;
   then x=y or x=0-y by XCMPLX_1:15,26;
  hence x=y or x=-y by XCMPLX_1:150;
 end;

theorem Th2: x^2=1 implies x=1 or x=-1
 proof assume x^2=1;
   then x^2-1^2=0 by SQUARE_1:59;
   then (x-1)*(x+1)=0 by SQUARE_1:67;
   then x-1=0 or x+1=0 by XCMPLX_1:6;
   then x-1+1=1 or x+1-1=0-1;
  hence x=1 or x=-1 by XCMPLX_1:26,27;
 end;

theorem Th3: 0<=x & x<=1 implies x^2<=x
 proof assume A1:0<=x & x<=1;
   per cases by A1;
   suppose 0=x; hence x^2<=x by SQUARE_1:60;
   suppose A2:0<x;
       now per cases by A1,REAL_1:def 5;
     case x=1; hence x^2<=x by SQUARE_1:59;
     case x<1; hence x^2<=x by A2,SQUARE_1:75;
     end;
    hence x^2<=x;
 end;

theorem Th4: a>=0 & (x-a)*(x+a)<=0 implies -a<=x & x<=a
 proof assume A1:a>=0 & (x-a)*(x+a)<=0;
   then A2:x-a>=0 & x+a<=0 or x-a<=0 & x+a>=0 by REAL_2:129;
   x+0<=x+a by A1,REAL_1:55;
   then x-a<=x+a-a by REAL_1:49;
   then x-a<=x by XCMPLX_1:26;
   then x<=a+0 & x+a>=0 by A1,A2,REAL_1:86;
   then x<=a & x>=0-a by REAL_1:86;
  hence -a<=x & x<=a by XCMPLX_1:150;
 end;

theorem Th5:
x^2-1<=0 implies -1<=x & x<=1
 proof assume x^2-1<=0;
  then 1>=0 & (x-1)*(x+1)<=0 by SQUARE_1:59,67;
  hence thesis by Th4;
 end;

theorem Th6:
 x < y & x < z iff x < min(y,z)
 proof
  thus x < y & x < z implies x < min(y,z) by SQUARE_1:38;
  assume A1:x < min(y,z);
    y>=min(y,z) & z>=min(y,z) by SQUARE_1:35;
  hence thesis by A1,AXIOMS:22;
 end;

theorem Th7:0<x implies x/3<x & x/4<x
  proof
   assume A1:0<x;
   then A2: 0<x/3 by SEQ_2:6;
   then A3:0+x/3<x/3+x/3 by REAL_1:53;
     x/3+x/3+0<x/3+x/3+x/3 by A2,REAL_1:53;
   then x/3+x/3<x by XCMPLX_1:69;
   hence x/3<x by A3,AXIOMS:22;
   A4: 0<x/4 by A1,SEQ_2:6;
   then A5:0+x/4<x/4+x/4 by REAL_1:53;
     x/4+x/4+0<x/4+x/4+x/4 by A4,REAL_1:53;
   then x/4< x/4+x/4+x/4 by A5,AXIOMS:22;
   then x/4+x/4<x/4+x/4+x/4+x/4 by REAL_1:53;
   then x/4+x/4< x by XCMPLX_1:71;
   hence x/4<x by A5,AXIOMS:22;
  end;

theorem Th8: (x>=1 implies sqrt x>=1) & (x>1 implies sqrt x>1)
proof
 hereby assume x>=1; hence sqrt x>=1 by SQUARE_1:83,94;
 end;
 assume x>1; hence sqrt x>1 by SQUARE_1:83,95;
end;

theorem Th9: x<=y & z<=u implies ].y,z.[ c= ].x,u.[
proof assume A1:x<=y & z<=u;
 let a be set;assume a in ].y,z.[;
   then a in {b where b is Real: y<b & b<z} by RCOMP_1:def 2;
   then consider b being Real such that A2:b=a & y<b & b<z;
     x<b & b<u by A1,A2,AXIOMS:22;
  hence a in ].x,u.[ by A2,JORDAN6:45;
end;

theorem for p being Point of TOP-REAL 2 holds
 |.p.| = sqrt((p`1)^2+(p`2)^2) &
 |.p.|^2 = (p`1)^2+(p`2)^2 by JGRAPH_1:46,47;

theorem for f being Function,B,C being set holds (f|B).:C = f.:(C /\ B)
 proof let f be Function,B,C be set;
   thus (f|B).:C c=f.:(C /\ B)
    proof let x be set;assume x in (f|B).:C;
      then consider y being set such that
      A1: y in dom (f|B) & y in C & x=(f|B).y by FUNCT_1:def 12;
         dom (f|B)=(dom f)/\ B by FUNCT_1:68;
       then A2:y in dom f & y in B by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
       then A3:y in C /\ B by A1,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
         (f|B).y=f.y by A1,FUNCT_1:68;
     hence thesis by A1,A2,A3,FUNCT_1:def 12;
    end;
    let x be set;assume x in f.:(C /\ B);
      then consider y being set such that
      A4: y in dom f & y in C /\ B & x=f.y by FUNCT_1:def 12;
      A5: y in C & y in B by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      then y in (dom f)/\ B by A4,XBOOLE_0:def 3;
      then A6:y in dom (f|B) by FUNCT_1:68;
      then (f|B).y=f.y by FUNCT_1:68;
     hence thesis by A4,A5,A6,FUNCT_1:def 12;
 end;

theorem Th12: for X being TopStruct,Y being non empty TopStruct,
 f being map of X,Y,
 P being Subset of X holds f|P is map of X|P,Y
proof let X be TopStruct,Y be non empty TopStruct,f be map of X,Y,
  P be Subset of X;
  set Q=P;
    Q = the carrier of (X|Q) by JORDAN1:1;

theorem Th33: for Kb,Cb being Subset of TOP-REAL 2 st
 Kb={q: -1=q`1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1 or q`1=1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1
      or -1=q`2 & -1<=q`1 & q`1<=1 or 1=q`2 & -1<=q`1 & q`1<=1}&
 Cb={p2 where p2 is Point of TOP-REAL 2: |.p2.|=1} holds Sq_Circ.:Kb=Cb
 proof let Kb,Cb be Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
  assume
   A1:Kb={q: -1=q`1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1 or q`1=1 & -1<=q`2 & q`2<=1

      Cb={p2 where p2 is Point of TOP-REAL 2: |.p2.|=1};
   thus Sq_Circ.:Kb c= Cb
    proof let y be set;assume y in Sq_Circ.:Kb;
      then consider x being set such that
