begin :: Preliminaries

  reserve i,j,k,n for Nat;

  theorem Th1:
   for A,B being Subset of TOP-REAL n holds
    A is Bounded or B is Bounded implies A /\ B is Bounded
   proof
    let A,B be Subset of TOP-REAL n;
    assume A1: A is Bounded or B is Bounded;
    per cases by A1;
     suppose A2: A is Bounded;
         A /\ B c= A by XBOOLE_1:17;
      hence A /\ B is Bounded by A2,JORDAN2C:16;
     end;
     suppose A3: B is Bounded;
         A /\ B c= B by XBOOLE_1:17;
      hence A /\ B is Bounded by A3,JORDAN2C:16;
   end;
   end;

  theorem Th2:
   for A,B being Subset of TOP-REAL n holds
    A is not Bounded & B is Bounded implies A \ B is not Bounded
   proof
    let A,B be Subset of TOP-REAL n;
    assume that
     A1: A is not Bounded and
     A2: B is Bounded;
    A3: A /\ B is Bounded by A2,Th1;
       (A \ B) \/ A /\ B = A \ (B \ B) by XBOOLE_1:52
       .= A \ {} by XBOOLE_1:37
       .= A;
    hence A \ B is not Bounded by A1,A3,TOPREAL6:76;
   end;

theorem Th3:
 for C being compact connected non vertical non horizontal Subset of TOP-REAL 2
 holds (W-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) > 1
 proof
  let C be compact connected non vertical non horizontal Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
A1: Cage(C,n)/.1 = N-min L~Cage(C,n) by JORDAN9:34;
then A2: 1 < (N-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by SPRECT_2:73;
     (N-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) <= (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:74;
then A3: 1 < (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A2,XREAL_1:2;
     (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) < (E-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:75;
then A4: 1 < (E-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A3,XREAL_1:2;
     (E-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) <= (S-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:76;
then A5: 1 < (S-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A4,XREAL_1:2;
     (S-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) < (S-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:77;
then A6: 1 < (S-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A5,XREAL_1:2;
     (S-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) <= (W-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:78;
  hence (W-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) > 1 by A6,XREAL_1:2;
end;

theorem Th4:
 for C being compact connected non vertical non horizontal Subset of TOP-REAL 2
 holds (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) > 1
 proof
  let C be compact connected non vertical non horizontal Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
A1: Cage(C,n)/.1 = N-min L~Cage(C,n) by JORDAN9:34;
then A2: 1 < (N-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by SPRECT_2:73;
     (N-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) <= (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:74;
  hence 1 < (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A2,XREAL_1:2;
end;

theorem Th5:
 for C being compact connected non vertical non horizontal Subset of TOP-REAL 2
 holds (S-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) > 1
 proof
  let C be compact connected non vertical non horizontal Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
A1: Cage(C,n)/.1 = N-min L~Cage(C,n) by JORDAN9:34;

     (N-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) <= (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:74;
then A3: 1 < (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A2,XREAL_1:2;
     (E-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) < (E-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
  by A1,SPRECT_2:75;
then A4: 1 < (E-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) by A3,XREAL_1:2;
     (E-min L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n) <= (S-max L~Cage(C,n))..Cage(C,n)
