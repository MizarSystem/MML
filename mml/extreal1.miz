begin  :: Operations "x * y","x / y", "|.x.|" in R_eal numbers

reserve x,y,z for R_eal;
reserve a for Real;

definition
  let x,y be R_eal;
  redefine func x * y -> R_eal;
  coherence by XXREAL_0:def 1;
end;

canceled 12;

theorem Th13:
  for x,y being R_eal holds for a,b being Real holds x = a & y = b
  implies x * y = a * b
proof
  let x,y be R_eal;
  let a,b be Real;
  assume
A1: x = a & y = b;
  reconsider a,b as real number;
  x * y = a * b by A1;
  hence thesis;
end;

reserve x,y for ext-real number;

definition
  let x,y be R_eal;
  redefine func x / y -> R_eal;
  coherence by XXREAL_0:def 1;
end;

canceled 18;

theorem Th32:
  for x,y being R_eal holds for a,b being Real st x = a & y = b
  holds x / y = a / b
proof
  let x,y be R_eal;
  let a,b be Real;
  assume
A1: x = a & y = b;
  reconsider a,b as real number;
  x / y = a / b by A1;
  hence thesis;
end;

definition
  canceled 2;
  let x be R_eal;
  func |. x .| -> R_eal equals
  :Def3:
  x if 0 <= x otherwise -x;
  coherence;
  consistency;
end;

canceled 3;

theorem
  for x being R_eal st 0 < x holds |. x .| = x by Def3;

theorem
  for x being R_eal st x < 0 holds |. x .| = -x by Def3;

theorem
  for a,b being Real holds a*b = R_EAL a * R_EAL b
proof
  let a,b be Real;
  R_EAL a = a & R_EAL b = b by MEASURE6:def 1;
  hence thesis by Th13;
end;

theorem
  for a,b being Real holds a/b = R_EAL a / R_EAL b
proof
  let a,b be Real;
  R_EAL a = a & R_EAL b = b by MEASURE6:def 1;
  hence thesis by Th32;
end;
