Lm1: for r being real number holds 0 <= r & r <= 1 iff r in the carrier of
I[01]

proof
  let r be real number;
A1: [.0,1.] = { r1 where r1 is Real : 0 <= r1 & r1 <= 1 } by RCOMP_1:def 1;
  r is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
  hence 0 <= r & r <= 1 implies r in the carrier of I[01] by A1,BORSUK_1:83;
  assume

  then ex r2 being Real st r2 = r & 0 <= r2 & r2 <= 1 by A1,BORSUK_1:83;
