 reserve T,T1,T2,S for non empty TopSpace;

Lm1:
  for r being real number holds
    0 <= r & r <= 1 iff r in the carrier of I[01]
proof
 let r be real number;
A1: r is Real by XREAL_0:def 1;
A2: [.0,1.] = { r1 where r1 is Real : 0 <= r1 & r1 <= 1 } by RCOMP_1:def 1;
 hence 0 <= r & r <= 1 implies r in the carrier of I[01] by A1,BORSUK_1:83;
 assume r in the carrier of I[01];
 then consider r2 being Real such that A3: r2 = r & 0 <= r2 & r2 <= 1
    by A2,BORSUK_1:83;
 thus thesis by A3;
end;

scheme FrCard { A() -> non empty set, X() -> set,
       F(set) -> set, P[set] }:
 Card { F(w) where w is Element of A(): w in X() & P[w] } <=` Card X()
proof
     consider f be Function such that
A1:  dom f = X() & for x be set st x in X() holds f.x = F(x) from FUNCT_1:sch 3
;
        { F(w) where w is Element of A(): w in X() & P[w]} c= rng f
     proof let x be set;
     assume x in { F(w) where w is Element of A(): w in X() & P[w]};
      then consider w being Element of A() such that
A2:     x = F(w) & w in X() & P[w];
           f.w = x by A1,A2;
      hence thesis by A1,A2,FUNCT_1:def 5;
     end;
   hence thesis by A1,CARD_1:28;

 then reconsider h as map of T,S  by A11,FUNCT_2:4;
 take h;
 thus h = f+*g;

   proof
    let P be Subset of S;
    assume A12: P is closed;

 A15: for x being set st x in [#] T1 holds h.x = f.x
      proof
       let x be set such that A16: x in [#] T1;

        P3 is closed & P4 is closed by A6,A7,A12,PRE_TOPC:def 12;
    then P3 is compact & P4 is compact by A3,A4,COMPTS_1:17;
    then P1 is compact & P2 is compact by A1,BORSUK_1:42;
