definition
  let X be BCI-algebra;
  let x,y be Element of X;
  let m,n be Element of NAT;
  func Polynom (m,n,x,y) -> Element of X equals
  (((x,(x\y)) to_power (m+1)),(y
  \x)) to_power n;
  coherence;
end;

reserve X,Y for BCI-algebra;
reserve a,x,y,z,u,v,h for Element of X;
reserve m1 for Nat,
  i,j,k,l,m,n for Element of NAT;
reserve f,f9,g for Function of NAT, the carrier of X;

theorem Th1:
  x <= y & y <= z implies x <= z
proof
  assume
  x <= y & y <= z;
  then x\y=0.X & y\z=0.X by BCIALG_1:def 11;
  hence x\z=0.X by BCIALG_1:3;
end;

theorem Th2:
  x <= y & y <= x implies x = y
proof
  assume
  x <= y & y <= x;
  then x\y=0.X & y\x=0.X by BCIALG_1:def 11;
  hence thesis by BCIALG_1:def 7;
end;

theorem Th3:
  for X being BCK-algebra,x,y being Element of X holds x\y <= x & (
  x,y) to_power (n+1) <= (x,y) to_power n
proof
  let X be BCK-algebra;
  let x,y be Element of X;
  ((x,y) to_power n\y)\(x,y) to_power n = ((x,y) to_power n\(x,y) to_power
  n)\y by BCIALG_1:7
    .= y` by BCIALG_1:def 5
    .= 0.X by BCIALG_1:def 8;
  then
A1: (x,y) to_power n\y <= (x,y) to_power n by BCIALG_1:def 11;
  (x\y)\x = (x\x)\y by BCIALG_1:7
    .= y` by BCIALG_1:def 5
    .= 0.X by BCIALG_1:def 8;
  hence thesis by A1,BCIALG_1:def 11,BCIALG_2:4;
end;

theorem Th4:
  for X being BCK-algebra,x being Element of X holds (0.X,x)
  to_power n = 0.X
proof
  let X be BCK-algebra;
  let x be Element of X;
  defpred P[Element of NAT] means $1<= n implies (0.X,x) to_power $1 = 0.X;
  now
    let k;
    assume
A1: k<= n implies (0.X,x) to_power k = 0.X;
    set m = k+1;
    assume
    m<=n;
    then (0.X,x) to_power m = x` by A1,BCIALG_2:4,NAT_1:13
      .= 0.X by BCIALG_1:def 8;
    hence (0.X,x) to_power m = 0.X;
  end;
  then
A2: for k st P[k] holds P[k+1];
A3: P[0] by BCIALG_2:1;
  for n holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 1(A3,A2);
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th5:
  for X being BCK-algebra,x,y being Element of X st m>=n holds (x,y
  ) to_power m <= (x,y) to_power n
proof
  let X be BCK-algebra;
  let x,y be Element of X;
  assume
  m>=n;
  then m - n is Element of NAT by NAT_1:21;
  then consider k being Element of NAT such that
A1: k=m-n;
  ((x,y) to_power k)\x = (x\x,y) to_power k by BCIALG_2:7
    .= (0.X,y) to_power k by BCIALG_1:def 5
    .= 0.X by Th4;
  then (x,y) to_power k <= x by BCIALG_1:def 11;
  then ((x,y) to_power k,y) to_power n <= (x,y) to_power n by BCIALG_2:19;
  then (x,y) to_power (k+n) <= (x,y) to_power n by BCIALG_2:10;

  for k being Element of NAT st k >=n holds (x,y) to_power n = (x,y)
  to_power k
  proof
    let k be Element of NAT;
    assume
    k >=n;
    then k - n is Element of NAT by NAT_1:21;
    then consider k1 being Element of NAT such that
A5: k1=k-n;
    (x,y) to_power n = ((x,y) to_power n,y) to_power k1
    proof
      defpred P[Element of NAT] means $1<= k1 implies (x,y) to_power n = ((x,y
      ) to_power n,y) to_power $1;
      now
        let k;
        assume

        assume
        m<=k1;

        ,NAT_1:13;
      end;
      then
