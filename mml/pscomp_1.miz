          r3, r1, r2, q3, p3 for Real;

Lm2: for X being Subset of REAL st X is bounded_below holds --X is
bounded_above
proof
  let X be Subset of REAL;
  given s such that
A1: s is LowerBound of X;
  take -s;
  let t be ext-real number;
  assume t in --X; then
  t in {-r2 where r2 is Element of COMPLEX : r2 in X} by MEMBER_1:def 2;
  then consider r2 being Element of COMPLEX such that
A2: t = -r2 and
A3: r2 in X;
  reconsider r3 = r2 as Real by A3;
  r3 >= s by A1,A3,XXREAL_2:def 2;
  hence thesis by A2,XREAL_1:26;
end;

Lm8: for X being non empty set, f being Function of X, REAL st f is with_min
holds -f is with_max
proof
  let X be non empty set, f be Function of X, REAL;
  assume that
A1: f.:X is bounded_below and
A2: lower_bound (f.:X) in f.:X;
A3: --(f.:X) = (-f).:X by MEASURE6:101;
  hence (-f).:X is bounded_above by A1,Lm2;
  then
A4: upper_bound ((-f).:X) = - lower_bound -- --(f.:X) by A3,MEASURE6:80
    .= - lower_bound (f.:X);
  - lower_bound (f.:X) in --(f.:X) by A2,MEMBER_1:11;
