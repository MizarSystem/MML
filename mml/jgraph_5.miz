proof
  let X be TopStruct,Y,Z be non empty TopStruct,f be Function of X,Y,
  h be Function of Y,Z;
  assume
A1: h is_homeomorphism & f is continuous;
  then h is continuous by TOPS_2:def 5;

theorem Th9:
  for X,Y,Z being TopStruct, f being Function of X,Y,
  h being Function of Y,Z st h is_homeomorphism & f is one-to-one

proof
  let X,Y,Z be TopStruct, f be Function of X,Y, h be Function of Y,Z;
  assume
A1: h is_homeomorphism & f is one-to-one;

  B being non empty Subset of S,f being Function of X,S|B, g being Function

  st h=g*f & f is continuous & g is continuous holds h is continuous
proof
  let X be TopStruct,S,V be non empty TopStruct, B be non empty Subset of S,
  f be Function of X,S|B, g be Function of S,V, h being Function of X,V;
  assume that
A1: h=g*f & f is continuous and
