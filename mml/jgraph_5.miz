reserve x,a for real number;

theorem Th1:
  a>=0 & (x-a)*(x+a)>=0 implies -a>=x or x>=a by XREAL_1:97;

theorem Th2: a<=0 & x<a implies x^2>a^2
proof assume A1: a<=0 & x<a;
  then --a<=0;
  then A2: -a>=0 by REAL_1:66;
      -x>-a by A1,REAL_1:50;
  then (-x)^2>(-a)^2 by A2,SQUARE_1:78;

 then a^2-(p`1)^2>=0 by SQUARE_1:72;
 then a^2-(p`1)^2+(p`1)^2>=0+(p`1)^2 by REAL_1:55;
 then A4: -a<=p`1 & p`1<=a by A2,JGRAPH_2:5;
  a^2-(p`2)^2>=0 by A3,SQUARE_1:72;
 then a^2-(p`2)^2+(p`2)^2>=0+(p`2)^2 by REAL_1:55;

        A5: [#](S|B)=B by PRE_TOPC:def 10;
        A6: the carrier of S|B =B by JORDAN1:1;

        .=f"F by A6,RELAT_1:168;
        hence h"P is closed by A1,A7,PRE_TOPC:def 12;
