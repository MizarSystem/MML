begin  :: Some theorems about R_eal numbers

 reserve x,y,a,b,a1,b1,a2,b2 for R_eal;

theorem Th1:
   x <> -infty & x <> +infty & x <=' y implies
   0. <=' y - x
proof
   assume
A1:x <> -infty & x <> +infty & x <=' y;
   consider z being R_eal such that
A2:z = 0.;
     z + x = x by A2,SUPINF_2:18;
   hence thesis by A1,A2,MEASURE4:2;
end;

theorem Th2:
   (not (x = -infty & y = -infty) & not (x = +infty & y = +infty) & x <=' y)
   implies 0. <=' y - x
proof
   assume
A1:not (x = -infty & y = -infty) & not (x = +infty & y = +infty) & x <=' y;
A2:   (x in REAL or x in {-infty,+infty}) & (y in REAL or y in {-infty,+infty})
   by SUPINF_1:def 6,XBOOLE_0:def 2;
   per cases by A1,A2,TARSKI:def 2;
   suppose x in REAL & y in REAL;
   then not x = -infty & not x = +infty by SUPINF_1:31;
   hence thesis by A1,Th1;
   end;
   suppose x in REAL & y = -infty;
   hence thesis by A1,SUPINF_1:23;
   end;
   suppose x in REAL & y = +infty;
   hence thesis by SUPINF_1:2,SUPINF_2:6,19;
   end;
   suppose x = -infty & y in REAL;
   hence thesis by SUPINF_1:6,SUPINF_2:7,19;
   end;
   suppose x = -infty & y = +infty;
   hence thesis by SUPINF_2:7,19;
