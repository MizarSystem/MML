theorem Th1:
  (for a holds a + 0.L = a) & (for a ex x st a+x = 0.L) & (for a,b,
  c holds (a+b)+c = a+(b+c)) implies (a+b = 0.L implies b+a = 0.L)
proof
  assume that

A2: for a ex x st a+x = 0.L and
A3: for a,b,c holds (a+b)+c = a+(b+c);
  consider x such that
A4: b + x = 0.L by A2;

A3: for a,b,c holds (a+b)+c = a+(b+c);
