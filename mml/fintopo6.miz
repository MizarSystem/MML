theorem
  for g being FinSequence of FT,A being Subset of FT, x1,x2 being
  Element of FT st g is_minimum_path_in A,x1,x2 holds g is one-to-one
proof
  let g be FinSequence of FT,A be Subset of FT, x1,x2 be Element of FT;
  assume
A1: g is_minimum_path_in A,x1,x2;
  then
A2: g is continuous by Def8;
A3: for h being FinSequence of FT st h is continuous & rng h c=A & h.1=x1 &
  h.(len h)=x2 holds len g <= len h by A1,Def8;
A4: rng g c=A by A1,Def8;
A5: g.1=x1 by A1,Def8;
A6: g.(len g)=x2 by A1,Def8;
  assume not g is one-to-one;
  then consider y1,y2 being set such that
A7: y1 in dom g and
A8: y2 in dom g and
