  for x being Element of A, y being Element of B holds
   [x,y] in R1 iff [x,y] in R2
    holds R1 = R2
proof
  let A,B be non empty set;
  let R1,R2 be Relation of A,B;
  assume A1: for x being Element of A, y being Element of B holds
     [x,y] in R1 iff [x,y] in R2;

    for a,b being set holds [a,b] in R1 iff [a,b] in R2
  proof
    let a,b be set;
    hereby assume A2: [a,b] in R1;
      then reconsider a'=a as Element of A by ZFMISC_1:106;
      reconsider b'=b as Element of B by A2,ZFMISC_1:106;
          [a',b'] in R2 by A1,A2;
      hence [a,b] in R2;

  proof
    let x be set;
    assume A3: x in f"(f.:A);
  then x in dom f & f.x in f.:A by FUNCT_1:def 13;
    then consider x0 being set such that
  A4:  x0 in X & x0 in A & f.x = f.x0 by FUNCT_2:115;
    thus thesis by A1,A3,A4;
