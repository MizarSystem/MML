  reconsider gg = <*p,q*> as FinSequence of the carrier of TOP-REAL 2;
A17: len gg = 2 by FINSEQ_1:61;
  take gg;
  thus gg is being_S-Seq by A4,A5,SPPOL_2:46;
  thus P = L~gg by A3,SPPOL_2:21;
  thus thesis by A17,FINSEQ_4:26;

theorem
  for f be FinSequence of TOP-REAL 2
  for p,q be Point of TOP-REAL 2 st p in L~f & q in L~f &
  ( Index(p,f) < Index(q,f) or
  Index(p,f) = Index(q,f) & LE p,q,f/.Index(p,f),f/.(Index(p,f)+1) ) &
  p <> q holds L~B_Cut(f,p,q) c= L~f by Lm4;
