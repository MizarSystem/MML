A1: for k be Element of NAT holds E.k=Fn(k) from FUNCT_2:sch 4;
  now
    let z be set;
    assume

    then
A2: ex x be Element of X st z=x & for k be natural number st n <= k holds
    x in F.k;
    for Y be set st Y in rng E holds z in Y
    proof
      let Y be set;
      assume
      Y in rng E;
      then consider l be set such that

      reconsider l as Element of NAT by A3;
      z in F.(n+l) by A2,NAT_1:12;
      hence thesis by A1,A4;
    end;
    hence z in meet rng E by SETFAM_1:def 1;
  end;
  then
A5: G c= meet rng E by TARSKI:def 3;
  rng E is N_Sub_set_fam of X by MEASURE1:52;

    hence G.n c= G.(n+1) by PROB_1:def 7;
  end;

  < +infty holds ex G be Function of NAT,S st G= superior_setsequence F & M.(

proof
  let M be sigma_Measure of S, F be SetSequence of S;

  reconsider F1 = F, G1 = G as SetSequence of X;
A1: for n being Element of NAT holds G.(n+1) c= G.n
  proof
    let n be Element of NAT;
    n<=n+1 by NAT_1:12;
    hence thesis by PROB_1:def 6;
  end;
  G.0 = union {F.k where k is Element of NAT : 0 <= k} by SETLIM_1:def 3;
  then
A2: G.0 = union rng F by SETLIM_1:5;
  consider f being SetSequence of X such that
A3: lim_sup F1 = meet f and
A4: for n being Element of NAT holds f.n = Union (F1^\n) by KURATO_2:
  def 4;
  now
    let n be Element of NAT;
    f.n = Union (F1^\n) by A4;
    hence f.n = G1.n by Th2;
  end;
  then
A5: f = G1 by FUNCT_2:113;
  assume
