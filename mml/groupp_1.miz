reserve G for Group,
  a,b for Element of G,
  m, n for Nat,
  p for prime (natural number);

theorem Th1:
  (for r being natural number holds n <> p |^ r) implies
  ex s being Element of NAT st s is prime & s divides n & s <> p
proof
  assume
A2: for r being natural number holds n <> p |^ r;
  per cases;
  suppose
a0:  n = 0;
    per cases;
    suppose
a1:   p = 2;
      take s = 3;
      thus s is prime by PEPIN:44;
      thus s divides n by a0,INT_2:16;
      thus s <> p by a1;
    end;
    suppose
a1:   p <> 2;
      take s = 2;
      thus s is prime by INT_2:44;
      thus s divides n by a0,INT_2:16;
      thus s <> p by a1;
    end;
  end;
  suppose
A1: n <> 0;
A3: p > 1 by INT_2:def 5;
  reconsider r1 = p |-count n as Element of NAT;
A4: p |^ r1 divides n by A1,A3,NAT_3:def 7;
A5: not p |^ (r1+1) divides n by A1,A3,NAT_3:def 7;
  consider s1 be natural number such that
A6: n = p |^ r1 * s1 by A4,NAT_D:def 3;
  s1 >= 2
  proof
    assume not s1 >= 2;
    then s1 < 1 + 1;
    then s1 <= 1 by NAT_1:13;
    then s1 = 0 or s1 = 1 by NAT_1:26;
    hence contradiction by A1,A2,A6;
  end;
  then consider s be Element of NAT such that
A7: s is prime and
A8: s divides s1 by INT_2:48;
A9: s1 divides n by A6,NAT_D:def 3;
  take s;
  s <> p
  proof
    assume s = p;
    then consider s2 be natural number such that
A10: s1 = p * s2 by A8,NAT_D:def 3;
    n = p |^ r1 * p * s2 by A6,A10
     .= p |^ (r1+1) * s2 by NEWTON:11;
    hence contradiction by A5,NAT_D:def 3;
  end;
  hence thesis by A7,A8,A9,NAT_D:4;
end;
end;

theorem Th2:
  for n,m being natural number holds n divides p |^ m implies
  ex r be natural number st n = p |^ r & r <= m
proof
  let n,m be natural number;
  assume
A1: n divides p |^ m;
  n > 0
  proof
    assume n <= 0;
    then n = 0;
    hence contradiction by A1,INT_2:3;
  end;
  then n in NatDivisors (p|^ m) by A1,MOEBIUS1:39;
  then n in {p|^ k where k is Element of NAT : k <= m} by NAT_5:19;
  then consider r be Element of NAT such that
A2: n = p|^ r & r <= m;
  take r;
  thus thesis by A2;
end;

theorem Th3:
  a |^ n = 1_G implies a" |^ n = 1_G
proof
  assume a |^ n = 1_G;
  then a" |^ n = (1_G)" by GROUP_1:72
          .= 1_G by GROUP_1:16;
  hence thesis;
end;

theorem Th4:
  a" |^ n = 1_G implies a |^ n = 1_G
proof
  a"" = a;
  hence thesis by Th3;
end;

theorem Th5:
  ord (a") = ord a
proof
  a |^ ord a = 1_G by GROUP_1:82;
  then a" |^ ord a = 1_G by Th3; then
A1: ord (a") divides ord a by GROUP_1:86;
  a" |^ ord (a") = 1_G by GROUP_1:82;
  then a |^ ord (a") = 1_G by Th4;
  then ord a divides ord (a") by GROUP_1:86;
  hence thesis by A1,NAT_D:5;
end;

theorem Th6:
  ord (a |^ b) = ord a
proof
  (a |^ b) |^ ord a = (a |^ ord a) |^ b by GROUP_3:33
                     .= (1_G) |^ b by GROUP_1:82
                     .= 1_G by GROUP_3:22; then
A2: ord (a |^ b) divides ord a by GROUP_1:86;
  (a |^ ord (a |^ b)) |^ b = (a |^ b) |^ ord (a |^ b) by GROUP_3:33
                          .= 1_G by GROUP_1:82;
  then ord a divides ord (a |^ b) by GROUP_3:23,GROUP_1:86;
  hence thesis by A2,NAT_D:5;
end;

theorem Th7:
  for G being Group, N being Subgroup of G

   st g in N & (a * b)|^ $1 = a |^ $1 * g;
A2: (a * b)|^ 0 = 1_G by GROUP_1:43;
    a |^ 0 * 1_G = 1_G * 1_G by GROUP_1:43
                .= 1_G by GROUP_1:def 5;
    then
A3: P[0] by A2,GROUP_2:55;
A4: now let n;
    assume P[n];
    then consider g1 be Element of G such that
A5: g1 in N & (a * b)|^ n = a |^ n * g1;
A6: (a * b)|^ (n + 1) = a |^ n * g1 * (a * b) by A5,GROUP_1:66
                     .= a |^ n * (g1 * (a * b)) by GROUP_1:def 4
                     .= a |^ n * ((g1 * a) * b) by GROUP_1:def 4;
    a * N = N * a by A1,GROUP_3:140;
    then g1 * a in a * N by A5, GROUP_2:126;
    then consider g2 be Element of G such that
A7: g1 * a = a * g2 & g2 in N by GROUP_2:125;
 (g1 * a) * b = a * (g2 * b) by A7,GROUP_1:def 4;
then  a |^ n * ((g1 * a) * b) = a |^ n * a * (g2 * b) by GROUP_1:def 4
                            .= a |^ (n + 1) * (g2 * b) by GROUP_1:66;
    hence P[n+1] by A1,A6,A7,GROUP_2:59;
  end;
  for n holds P[n] from NAT_1:sch 2(A3,A4);
  hence thesis;

proof
  let G be Group;
  let N be normal Subgroup of G;
  let a be Element of G;
  let S be Element of G./.N;
  assume
