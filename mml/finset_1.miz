   defpred P[set] means ex y st $1={y};
   consider X being set such that
    A30: for x holds x in X iff x in bool A & P[x] from XBOOLE_0:sch 1;
      for x holds x in union X iff x in A
    proof
     let x;
     thus x in union X implies x in A
      proof
       assume x in union X;
       then consider B such that A31: x in B and A32: B in X by TARSKI:def 4;
          B in bool A by A30,A32;
       hence thesis by A31;

     assume x in A;
     then {x} c= A by ZFMISC_1:37;
     then A33: {x} in X by A30;
        x in {x} by TARSKI:def 1;
     hence thesis by A33,TARSKI:def 4;

   then A34: union X = A by TARSKI:2;
   A35: for B st B in X holds B is finite
    proof
     let B; assume B in X;
     then ex y st B = {y} by A30;
     hence thesis;
    end;
      X c= bool A
    proof
     let x; assume x in X;

theorem
    A is finite & (for X st X in A holds X is finite) iff union A is finite
 proof
  thus A is finite & (for X st X in A holds X is finite) implies
   union A is finite by Lm3;
  thus union A is finite implies
   A is finite & for X st X in A holds X is finite
    proof
     assume A1: union A is finite;
     then A2: bool union A is finite by Th24;
        A c= bool union A by ZFMISC_1:100;
     hence A is finite by A2,Th13;
     thus for X st X in A holds X is finite
      proof
       let X; assume X in A;
       then X c= union A by ZFMISC_1:92;
       hence thesis by A1,Th13;
      end;
    end;

theorem
    dom f is finite implies rng f is finite
  proof
   assume dom f is finite;
   then f.:(dom f) is finite by Th17;
   hence thesis by RELAT_1:146;
  end;

theorem
    Y c= rng f & f"Y is finite implies Y is finite
  proof
   assume that A1: Y c= rng f and A2: f"Y is finite;
      f.:(f"Y) = Y by A1,FUNCT_1:147;
   hence thesis by A2,Th17;
  end;

theorem Th28:
  X is finite & Y is finite implies X \+\ Y is finite
 proof assume X is finite & Y is finite;
   then X \ Y is finite & Y \ X is finite by Th16;
   then (X \ Y) \/ (Y \ X) is finite by Lm2;
   hence thesis by XBOOLE_0:def 6;
 end;

registration let X, Y be finite set;
  cluster X \+\ Y -> finite;
  coherence by Th28;
