reserve X for RealUnitarySpace;
reserve x, y, y1, y2 for Point of X;

Lm1: for x, y, z, e be Real holds abs(x-y) < e/2 & abs(y-z) < e/2 implies abs(
x-z) <e

proof
  let x, y, z, e be Real;
  assume
  abs(x-y) < e/2 & abs(y-z) <e/2;

  then abs((x-y)+(y-z)) <= abs(x-y)+abs(y-z) & abs(x-y)+abs(y-z) < e/2+e/2 by
COMPLEX1:142,XREAL_1:10;

  hence thesis by XXREAL_0:2;
end;

Lm2: for p being real number st p > 0 ex k be Element of NAT st 1/(k+1) < p
proof
  let p be real number;
  consider k1 be Element of NAT such that
A1: p" < k1 by SEQ_4:10;
  assume
  p > 0;
  then
A2: 0 < p" by XREAL_1:124;
  take k = k1;
  p"+0 < k1+1 by A1,XREAL_1:10;
  then 1/(k1+1) < 1/p" by A2,XREAL_1:78;
  hence thesis by XCMPLX_1:218;
end;

Lm3: for p being real number, m being Element of NAT st p > 0 ex i be Element
of NAT st 1/(i+1) < p & i >= m

proof
  let p be real number, m be Element of NAT;
  consider k1 be Element of NAT such that
A1: p"<k1 by SEQ_4:10;
  assume
  p > 0;
  then
A2: 0<p" by XREAL_1:124;
  take i = k1+m;
  k1 <= k1 + m by NAT_1:11;
  then p" < i by A1,XXREAL_0:2;
  then p"+0 < i+1 by XREAL_1:10;
  then 1/(i+1) < 1/p" by A2,XREAL_1:78;
