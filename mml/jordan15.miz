  theorem
      for A,B be Subset of TOP-REAL 2 st A meets B holds
    proj1.:A meets proj1.:B
   proof
    let A,B be Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
    assume A meets B;
    then consider e be set such that

    reconsider e as Point of TOP-REAL 2 by A1;
    A3: e`1 = proj1.e by PSCOMP_1:def 28;

   proof
    let S being compact Subset of TOP-REAL 2;

   proof
    let C be Simple_closed_curve;
    let i,j,k be Nat;
    assume that
     A1: 1 < i & i < len Gauge(C,n+1) and
     A2: 1 <= j & j <= k & k <= width Gauge(C,n+1) and
     A3: Gauge(C,n+1)*(i,k) in Upper_Arc L~Cage(C,n+1) and
     A4: Gauge(C,n+1)*(Center Gauge(C,n+1),j) in Lower_Arc L~Cage(C,n+1);
       len Gauge(C,n+1) >= 4 by JORDAN8:13;
    then len Gauge(C,n+1) >= 2 & len Gauge(C,n+1) >= 3 by AXIOMS:22;
    then 1 < Center Gauge(C,n+1) & Center Gauge(C,n+1) < len Gauge(C,n+1)
