  theorem
      for A,B be Subset of TOP-REAL 2 st A meets B holds
    proj1.:A meets proj1.:B
   proof
    let A,B be Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
    assume A meets B;
    then consider e be set such that

    reconsider e as Point of TOP-REAL 2 by A1;
    A3: e`1 = proj1.e by PSCOMP_1:def 28;
    then A4: e`1 in proj1.:A by A1,FUNCT_2:43;

   proof
    let S being compact Subset of TOP-REAL 2;
