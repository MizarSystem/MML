  let X be set;
  let C be C_Measure of X;
  cluster sigma_Meas(C) -> nonnegative sigma-additive zeroed;
  coherence by Th23;
end;

theorem Th24:
  for A being Subset of X holds C.A = 0. implies A in sigma_Field(C)
proof
  let A be Subset of X;
  assume
A1: C.A = 0.;
  now
    let W,Z be Subset of X;
    assume that
A2: W c= A and
    Z c= X \ A;
    Z c= W \/ Z by XBOOLE_1:7;
    then
A3: C.Z <= C.(W \/ Z) by Def2;
    C is nonnegative by Def2;
    then 0.<= C.W by MEASURE1:def 4;
    then C.W = 0. by A1,A2,Def2;
    hence C.W + C.Z <= C.(W \/ Z) by A3,XXREAL_3:4;
  end;
  hence thesis by Def3;
end;

theorem
  sigma_Meas(C) is_complete sigma_Field(C)
proof
  let A be Subset of X;
  let B;
  assume that
A1: B in sigma_Field(C) and
A2: A c= B and
A3: (sigma_Meas(C)).B = 0.;
  reconsider B as Subset of X by A1;
  C is nonnegative by Def2;
  then
A4: 0.<= C.A by MEASURE1:def 4;
  C.B = 0. by A1,A3,Def4;
  then C.A = 0. by A2,A4,Def2;
  hence thesis by Th24;
