theorem Th4:
  for i,j being natural number holds
  j > 0 & i mod j = 0 implies i div j = i / j
  proof
    let i,j be natural number;
    assume
A1:   j > 0;
    assume i mod j = 0;
    then consider t being Nat such that
A2:   i = j * t + 0 and
A3:   0 < j by A1,NAT_1:def 2;
    thus i div j = t by A2,A3,NAT_1:def 1
      .= i / j by A1,A2,XCMPLX_1:90;
  end;

theorem Th5:
  for i,n being natural number holds

  proof
    let i,n be natural number;
    assume
A1:   n > 0;
    per cases by NAT_1:19;
    suppose
A2:   i > 0;
        i |^ n mod i = 0 by A1,PEPIN:37;
    hence i |^ n div i = i |^ n / i by A2,Th4;
    end;
    suppose
A3:   i = 0;
        n >= 0+1 by A1,NAT_1:38;
    then i |^ n = 0 by A3,NEWTON:16;
    hence i |^ n div i = i |^ n / i by A3,NAT_1:def 1;
  end;
  end;

theorem Th6:
 for n being natural number holds
 0 < n & 1 < r implies 1 < r|^n
  proof
    let n be natural number;
    assume that

    defpred P[natural number] means 0 < $1 implies 1 < r|^$1;

    proof
      let k be natural number;
      assume that
A5:     P[k] and 0 < k+1;
      per cases by NAT_1:19;
      suppose

A7:   r|^(k+1) = (r|^k)*r by NEWTON:11;
          r > 0 by A2,AXIOMS:22;
      then 1 * r <= (r|^k)*r by A5,A6,AXIOMS:25;
      hence thesis by A2,A7,AXIOMS:22;
      end;
      suppose k = 0;
      hence thesis by A2,NEWTON:10;
   end;
   end;
     for k being natural number holds P[k] from NAT_1:sch 2(A3,A4);
   hence thesis by A1;

 r > 1 & m > n implies r|^m > r|^n
  proof
    let m,n be natural number;
    assume that
A1:   r > 1 and
A2:   m > n;
reconsider m,n as Nat by ORDINAL2:def 21;
A3: r > 0 by A1,AXIOMS:22;
        (m-'n)+n = m by A2,AMI_5:4;
then A4:  r|^m = r|^(m-'n)*r|^n by NEWTON:13;
        m-'n <> 0 by A2,JORDAN4:1;
    then m-'n > 0 by NAT_1:19;
then A5:  r|^(m-'n) > 1 by A1,Th6;
        r|^n > 0 by A3,HEINE:5;
    hence thesis by A4,A5,REAL_2:144;

        A = A /\ B by A4,XBOOLE_1:28;

    A7: A1 meets C1 by A3,A5,XBOOLE_0:def 7;
        A1 is connected by A1,JORDAN2C:15;

    then consider k being Nat such that
A1:   len f = 2*k+1 by SCMFSA9A:1;
A2: 2*k mod 2 = 0 by NAT_1:63;

       .= 2 * (len f div 2 + 1) - 2
       .= 2 * Center f - 2 by Def1;
