begin  :: Operations "x * y","x / y", "|.x.|" in R_eal numbers

reserve x,y,z for R_eal;
reserve a for Real;

definition
  let x,y be R_eal;
  redefine func x * y -> R_eal;
end;

canceled 12;

theorem :: EXTREAL1:13
  for x,y being R_eal holds for a,b being Real holds x = a & y = b
  implies x * y = a * b;

reserve x,y for ext-real number;

definition
  let x,y be R_eal;
  redefine func x / y -> R_eal;
end;

canceled 18;

theorem :: EXTREAL1:32
  for x,y being R_eal holds for a,b being Real st x = a & y = b
  holds x / y = a / b;

definition

  let x be R_eal;
  func |. x .| -> R_eal equals
:: EXTREAL1:def 3

  x if 0 <= x otherwise -x;
end;

canceled 3;

theorem :: EXTREAL1:36
  for x being R_eal st 0 < x holds |. x .| = x;

theorem :: EXTREAL1:37
  for x being R_eal st x < 0 holds |. x .| = -x;

theorem :: EXTREAL1:38
  for a,b being Real holds a*b = R_EAL a * R_EAL b;

theorem :: EXTREAL1:39
  for a,b being Real holds a/b = R_EAL a / R_EAL b;
