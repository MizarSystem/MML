theorem :: COMPLSP1:1
  the topology of the_Complex_Space n = ComplexOpenSets n;

theorem :: COMPLSP1:2
  the carrier of the_Complex_Space n = COMPLEX n;

reserve p,q for Point of the_Complex_Space n,
  V for Subset of the_Complex_Space n;

theorem :: COMPLSP1:3
  p is Element of COMPLEX n;

theorem :: COMPLSP1:4
  for A being Subset of COMPLEX n st A = V holds A is open iff V is open;

theorem :: COMPLSP1:5
  for A being Subset of COMPLEX n st A = V holds A is closed iff V is closed;

theorem :: COMPLSP1:6
  the_Complex_Space n is T_2;

theorem :: COMPLSP1:7
  the_Complex_Space n is regular;
