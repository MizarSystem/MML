Mizar - Version 7.9.03 (Linux/FPC) (MML 4.108.1028)
August 06, 2008

Copyright (C) 1990, 2008 Association of Mizar Users

 This version of the Mizar system has been precompiled with Free Pascal 
Compiler (ver. 2.0.0) for i386 compatible machines running the Linux operating 
system. The package contains the Mizar processor, the Mizar database, a set of
utility programs, and GNU Emacs Lisp mode for convenient work with the system. 
All Mizar articles constituting the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) and their 
abstracts are also included in this release. 

                   1. Hardware requirements

 This version of the Mizar system has been tested on Linux machines with 
kernels 2.4.x but it should also work with other kernels. The installation
requires about 160 MB of free disk space.

                   2. Installing the system

   The script 'install.sh' unpacks the Mizar system to specified directories.
In most cases it is enough to call

./install.sh

and then answer three questions about the place where files should be copied.

There are two options that may be used with this script:

./install.sh --default
runs the script in non-interactive mode (see below for default directories),

./install.sh --nodialog
always runs the script in plain mode (without 'dialog' utility)
getting input directly from STDIN (useful for writing scripts).

When run in interactive mode, first you must provide a name of a directory 
where you want to install Mizar executables (default is /usr/local/bin). 
Make sure this directory is in your PATH variable.

Then you will be prompted to choose a directory for Mizar shared files
(default is /usr/local/share/mizar). 

NOTE: After the installation you must set a variable MIZFILES to point to this 
directory. Otherwise, the system will not find the database correctly. 

Finally you will be asked about a directory where Mizar documentation files
should be placed (default is /usr/local/doc/mizar). 

   ********************************************************************** 
      Note that a new version always replaces an old one completely 
      if the same directories are specified during both installations.
