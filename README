Mizar - Version 6.4.02 (Linux/FPC) (MML 3.66.807)
January 07, 2004

Copyright (C) 1990, 2003 Association of Mizar Users

 This is a version of the Mizar system for use on machines running
Linux on Intel. Mizar system was originally implemented on IBM-PC, AT, 
PS/2 or compatible under the MS DOS, ver. 6.0 operating system. Current 
version was compiled with Free Pascal Compiler ver. 1.0.6.
 
This distribution contains Mizar processor, the database, Mizar abstracts
and a complete set of tools necessary for convenient work. Mizar Mathematical 
Library (MML) is also included in this release. 

                   1. Hardware requirements

 This version of Mizar system was tested on Linux with kernels 2.0.x, 
2.2.x and 2.4.x on Intel Pentium machines. As a rule the Mizar processor, 
the database (public) of the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML), and abstracts 
of the Mizar articles from the MML are installed on a hard disk, they need 
about 80 MB of disk space.

                   2. Installing the system

   You can use shell script 'install' to set up Mizar system and
the database (MML) on a hard disk. In most cases it is enough to call
./install
and answer three questions where to unpack suitable Mizar files.
However, there are two optional switches that can be used with the script:

./install --default
runs the script in non-interactive mode (see below for the default directories
chosen in this mode),

./install --nodialog
always runs the script in plain mode (without the use of 'dialog' program)
getting input directly from stdin.

Installation depends on the directories you specify.
Note that the new version completely replaces the old one in case the same 
directories are specified. You will be asked for a directory name where you 
want to install Mizar executables (default is /usr/local/bin). Note that 
Mizar verifier and tools will be copied to that directory and therefore it 
must be on the system PATH. Check with
 echo $PATH
whether the PATH variable contains the directory of your choice. If not 
you should call (in bash)
 PATH=$PATH:your_directory
 export PATH  
This will add your_directory to the system PATH. 
Then you will be prompted to choose a directory for Mizar shared files
(default is /usr/local/share/mizar). After installation it is necessary
to set a variable MIZFILES.                                   ^^^^^^^^^
For example, if you just pressed ENTER you have to call (in bash)
 MIZFILES=/usr/local/share/mizar
 export MIZFILES
but if you typed my_shared_mizar_dir then you have to call 
 MIZFILES=my_shared_mizar_dir
 export MIZFILES  
If you forget to do it, Mizar verifier and tools will not work properly.
Finally you will be asked for a directory where Mizar documentation files
should be placed (default is /usr/local/doc/mizar).
